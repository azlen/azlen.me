    + added page for digital spaces blog club
    + renamed projects page so that current projects link ends in 703 redirect

[------] social + webring links

[------] shoes! I just need a couple pictures of shoes (I'll take a picture of might with different colors)
    > ask Matt (and Jon?) for pictures of their shooes

[------] set up redirects for every page on old site to point to old.azlen.me
    ? is it possible to get some kind of sitemap

[      ] figure out what I'd like as the default theme for the site

-------------------------------------------------------------------

# LOWER PRIORITY #

[      ] theme switcher

[      ] get interfaces journal off the ground

[-     ] create backlinks
    + found someone who's already implemented jekyll backlinks, as well as clustering by related tags: https://github.com/rgvr/simply-jekyll/blob/master/_includes/Backlinks.html

[      ] bring in quotebacks, as an include?

[      ] figure out how to use the citation plugin properly...

[      ] figure out how to bring back chladni patterns... or should I? maybe only for hub pages?

[      ] split links into a bunch of spans to bring back hover animation across multiple lines?

[      ] create project page and documentation for various different projects both current, past and future
    > I like the idea of "future" projects, and that can also tie in with the "sidequest" or "weekend project" idea
    > What are my current projects?

        - Helping out with Spiel
    > For past projects, how much should I include? maybe style BIG projects and small experiments differently? have some kind of categorization system...
        > luckily I already have some of these projects documented (at least minorly) so I can start by copying over some of those
