[      ] split links into a bunch of spans to bring back hover animation across multiple lines?

[      ] create project page and documentation for various different projects both current, past and future
    > I like the idea of "future" projects, and that can also tie in with the "sidequest" or "weekend project" idea
    > For past projects, how much should I include? maybe style BIG projects and small experiments differently? have some kind of categorization system...
        > luckily I already have some of these projects documented (at least minorly) so I can start by copying over some of those
