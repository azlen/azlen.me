Inspired by working on [5D Set](/@/5d-set), I thought it'd be interesting to explore yet another variation on the game: *what if instead of three variations of each property you had four?*

This of course means that each set contains *four* cards instead of three, making the game much harder even than *5-dimensional Set* because you can no longer rely any card pair having one single card that will make them into a set.
