Having played [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) all my life, I was inspired one day to design *5D Set*. Adding one new dimension on top of the existing four: *number*, *colour*, *shape*, and *fill*.

After much visual experimentation I settled at last on the border around each shape as the 5th property, with *solid*, *doubled*, and *dashed* borders:

On top of adding a 5th dimension and thus making this game much harder to play and shuffle (with a whopping 243 cards!), I have considered a number of other aspects such as: making the squiggles rotationally symmetric[^bothered], the colours more colourblind-friendly[^interestingly], and various aesthetic tweaks, rounded corners, and retro-style card backs with a 5D twist.

[^interestingly]: Interestingly, *5D Set* naturally contains within it three sets of accessible decks of regular (4D) *Set* as you can simply remove the dimension of colour entirely now that you have a new visual property to replace it.<br><br>Additionally, this is useful to non-colourblind folk as well if you happen to be playing under adversarial lighting conditions (like at a party)

[^bothered]: Something which always bothered me about the original game
