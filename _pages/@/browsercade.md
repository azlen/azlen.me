An idea for a project packaging together a set of small experimental browser experiences. Not intended to be complete browsers that you use every day but as a way to lay out a set of future possibilities and get feedback on them. What would a browser look like without tabs? or with different forms of navigation? or where instead of moving your cursor you move the page around your cursor?
