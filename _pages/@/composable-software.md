What to write?

This should ideally be the "homepage" for this larger overall umbrella project — not just for others to be able to explore, but possibly also for myself. This is my research hub and place of documentation for this project, a place from which I will link out to various individual explorations, ideas, and visions.

I also want to pull in my tech-tree here for sure...

I have [struggled](/@/glimpses-of-infinity) in the past to clearly capture my thoughts on this project. Even the word "composable" does not seem to fit nicely; emergent or systemic may do just as well[^videogames]. In essence, my goal is to imagine (and work towards actually building) a new foundation for software that puts agency into the hands of the people who use it, a world in which anyone, anywhere, has the power to take control of their own digital space and workflow. 

[^videogames]: Borrowing terminology from video games here, which tend to be years ahead of software experientially due to the simple incentive of making things fun

Perhaps it may be useful for me in fact to start from the beginning. To write and build the project from the ground up in a more public-facing way — maybe in the form of videos published to my YouTube channel.
