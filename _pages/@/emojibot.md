Discord bot that allows piping or transcluding messages between channels using emoji reactions. Made in collaboration with [Jonathan Borichevskiy](https://jon.bo) for a private discord server, the idea proved quite useful to us and slowly spread to a handful of new servers.

Building emojibot also led us to explore a number of adjacent ideas and affordances around reactions, like a paginated image gallery, reaction-based moderation, or piping to external locations such as publishing messages to a public stream.

*Work is almost complete on a new version which we plan to release more publicly.*

## Next Steps

- Create basic interface for modifying server/channel settings
- Make website for the project
