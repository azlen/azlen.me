I've never cared much for gifts. Receiving a gift means being surprised by something I may never have wanted or needed, and nothing makes me more ashamed than not liking something someone gives me.

It wasn't until receiving a particularly thoughtful (and simple!) gift from a friend and watching Van Neistat's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqYIkm66RSI) on the principles of gifting that I really opened my eyes to the __importance of gifts__. He proposes a trifecta of __nice, made, and thoughtful__; a good gift covers two of these, a great gift three. I walked away from the video feeling inspired to give more gifts, more often, and to make things by hand.

Writing this page is an attempt to capture this moment of inspiration to serve as a reminder to my future self. A couple years from now I want this page to be like a gallery of all the tiny gifts I've made for my friends.
