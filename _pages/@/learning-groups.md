I've [run a few](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1305625480997949440) peer-learning groups in the past, starting a ["learn with me"](/learn) page on my website. Of these, the most successful was the Chinese learning group because, I realized after, we all had the same goal. Other groups felt more scattered, where we'd all come together around a topic but had different reasons for doing so so it was hard to unify around any project or exercise we could work towards as a group. Not that this is necessary, but one of my primary objectives here is to uncover new structures and constraints that enable small groups to form, explore, and [generate new artifacts](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1269696513527046145) together as a trail to those who might follow in their footsteps.

The eventual goal is to create a platform that brings out the serendipitous connection and formation of small groups passionate about learning and exploring new territories of thought.

## Where am I at now?

- Building out a page of [side quests](/side-quests), small projects simmering on the back burner that would be fun to collaborate with anyone on. Hopefully I can inspire other people to make their own pages of side-quests and spark a little network of informal collaborative groups.

- Starting a new set of learning groups (see: [/learn](/learn)) with focused output goals, mostly running solo or in very small groups to better experiment with structures around making and artifacting
- One of these groups in-particular is focused on developing a pattern language for the formation and continuation of *generative spaces* \[groups, communities, platforms\]

## What are the next steps?

- Slowly bring more people into the fold of regular group making, and explore a variety of different structures: asynchronous, sprint, chained groups, etc.
- Explore low-effort solutions to building a platform using (for the most part) tools that already exist, that would act as a kind of conductive substrate enabling new groups to form around topics and goals people are interested in pursuing together
