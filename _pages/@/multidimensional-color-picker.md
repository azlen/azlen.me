*An prototype[^inspiration] of a new kind of color picker that allows you to explore three-dimensional color-space in two dimensions through one continuous interaction.*

[^inspiration]: Vaguely inspired by a *GPT-written* design fiction [story](/stories/on-the-paths-of-nonsense#lok1)

Someday I would like to experiment further with this idea. Play around with creating four-dimensional or even five-dimensional sliders, or even a [dasher-like](https://www.inference.org.uk/dasher/) interface where as you move your cursor in a particular direction, the possibility space warps and changes around you.
