Experiment in creating perceptual shift ambigrams, words that can be read as two different words depending on how the shape of the letters is interpereted.

Created 1200+ hand-drawn glyphs combining 2 or more letters (e.g T+F, ls+u), and coded a small web interface in which you can input your own words for it to merge.

Unfortunately Google deleted the database containing all the glyphs when they bought *Firebase* and I have yet to find backups or even screenshots of the interface in the time before it was deleted.
