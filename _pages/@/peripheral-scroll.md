Inspired by the thickness of books and the warped top-down world of animal crossing, I wanted to see the entire article I'm reading at once.

![](/files/videos/scroll-squish-text.mp4){autoplay=true muted=true loop=true controls=false}

I still want to continue this experiment a few steps further. *How would this peripheral scroll feel like on a two-dimensional canvas? with images? what would it be like to read content on the internet with this method of scrolling?*
