## Past
<!--Under construction... Please come back later?

â€”

Documenting my projects is extremely difficult, I honestly don't know where to start. I have made hundreds of projects and experiments over the years, to document everything in detail could result in multiple full-length books.

Also, what counts as a project? Versus an experiment?

I think perhaps a project is something that is larger scale or can continue for a much longer length of time. For example coming up with an alternative way to play bananagrams might be an experiment, but the compilation of all these alternate modes of playing is an ongoing project.-->

Thinking of organizing like this:

Major projects / research: (what to call this?)
- Cozyroom
- Neuropolis (am I ever?)
- Interhackt
- Future of computing
- Musical instrument experiments (?)
- Comic editor (?)
- Sprite generator (?)
- Game engine (?)

And then smaller projects / experiments:
- Everything else??

Perhaps instead of projects I could even consider this to be "things I've done" which could be a broader listing of everything that I'm thinking and researching about. 

Also, most of the projects will have been written about post-mortem so that should be taken into consideration when writing their descriptions. Perhaps I may  put a note at the top of the page indicating that I am writing in the future about something in the past.

It would also be interesting if I had some way of tracking the themes present (perhaps I could do this through side-notes?), in some way describing the trajectory of my paths through ideas.
