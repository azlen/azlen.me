## Hypotheses

- Can a sufficiently interconnected set of interopable tools and transformations between data types lead to user-driven evolution and emergence of new kind of interfaces?
- 

## General
*Some of these probably don't make too much sense without context*

- How to define transformations between data structures?
- How to add functions, to make the graph programmable?
- How should data be rendered?
- How can time be handled?
- Am I even asking the right questions?
