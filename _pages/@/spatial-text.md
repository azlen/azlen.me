Just a fun little typography toy where you can draw a path and type along it. The longer you hold a key down the longer the letter stretches out. It's really fun to interact with!

I was thinking it'd be fun to turn into a collaborative experience. Perhaps a way to chat back and forth with someone in a space. One idea was to integrate this squishy-text-drawing into [Cozyroom](/@/cozyroom), where I already have a similar drawing mechanism for selecting objects around you.
