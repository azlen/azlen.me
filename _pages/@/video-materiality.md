An attempt to capture a glimpse into interface materiality. On some level perhaps this experiment is a little ridiculousâ€” rotating a video in 3D? Why would anyone want to do that? But that is not the point. The point is that it should be *possible* for someone to rotate a video in three dimensions if they so wish.

Seeing a video as a three-dimensional object changes your relationship with it. Seeing visually that each frame of the video is just a small slice makes me curious: *what if I sliced the video along a different angle? what if I compressed it down to a 1D line of the most prominent or average colour at each timestamp?*

Each of these questions can itself lead to new ideas, new questions, and new projects.
