It feels like people are excited about all the wrong things... and I'm afraid that will lead us down the wrong direction. I worry because every time I look at something and think to myself that some technology is flawed and going nowhere it ends of growing much much bigger than I could ever have expected (and never really fixing its flaws...)


We are like digital slave owners. You know the thought process isn't that much different right? 



What does an AI that extends our sense of self look like? that is designed as a true "tool" that you have proper feedback loops with?

I don't want to argue against AI flat-out, I think there is some nuance here. I just think this whole "chatbot" craze is pretty shitty. We only get excited about things we can exploit for profit nowadays. And we so often forget that exploiting things for profit means exploiting real people. 

So we exploit AI as a slave in order to faster create products to exploit humans. What the fuck?



McLuhan famously says "we shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us"...

He talks about embodied interaction with our tools, how they become an extension of our bodies of a sort. And this is important! You get so much active feedback and learning by a really direct loop of interaction with a tool (say, a hammer or a car).

Chat-based AI interfaces are a huge step backwards in this regard. They are not embodied, they are a "disembodied tool".

Who will improve the most as an artist? someone who draws with a pencil or someone who gives their pencil to a friend and narrates over the phone what they want drawn. Interacting with AI models today feels like the latter â€“ there is no real feedback loop for ourselves to improve. It is a disembodied tool. And this is horrible.

Destroying the feedback loops of improvement could have seriously disasterous effects!! Like, what the hell? 

It certainly is possible to create embodied tools with AI, however this does require a modicum of creativity that is lacking in most present buzzword-filled discourse.

I'm just feeling really salty today...



Some notes on the above:
- AI (at least in chatbot form) breaks a really important feedback loop necessary for mastery of tools
- Yet also it creates a new kind of feedback loop, one never really seen before...
	- In the past, the tool lets us more directly shape the material..... no
	- Feedback loop with your tool vs feedback loop with the material???
	- The underlying substrate of all possibilities??
	- I don't even know how to put words to this
		- Okay, what is the exact experience that led me to write it then?
			- Well, I'm thinking about two things. First is the idea of annotation, or pattern-finding, using these large-scale language models as a kind of mirror of humanity
