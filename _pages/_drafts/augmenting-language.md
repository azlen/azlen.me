Language exists in a strange kind of equilibrium, in a balance of the number of words the average person can use and understand.

I've been thinking lately about research methods, and the thoughts I can or cannot think with the language I use.

Critics of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis say (laughably) that language does not affect thought, that everything which we have words for can be independently conceptualized without the existence of those words. What a load of rubbish. Have these people never coined their own word before? have they never been playfully creative with language in any way whatsoever? I have personally experienced many moments where a word I've made up for myself has sparked thoughts or ideas that I would not have had without it.

Yes, I can communicate those thoughts to someone without needing whatever specialized vocabulary I've created for myself, and theoretically I could also have had those thoughts independently of the word itself. But it's also theoretically possible for all the molecules in your body to spontaneously teleport to the moon. What's special about new vocabulary is that they get us closer to the precipice of unexplored ideas, it becomes easier to be pushed over that eureka threshold.

It also clearly doesn't take into consideration that language is the lens through which we see the world. The colours and shapes you see in front of your eyes don't *mean* anything unless you can understand what you're seeing. Humans, unlike animals, have the ability to augment their own perception of the world through use of language.


There seems to be a fear of new words. Maybe it's always been there, but certainly been exacerbated by modern technology. (it's also interesting that we're in a time where more people are literate than ever but the average vocabulary in north america has been steadily declining for a while). There is a kind of blind trust in dictionaries as a source of truth, we celebrate authors who invented words long ago (wow, good job shakespeare) but we seem afraid to extend or play with language in the present.

In a sense I want to experiment with an anti-1984, instead of simplifying english to limit the thoughts people can think — in what ways can we extend english, potentially in ways that are still comprehensible to people who are familiar with existing words?


Suffixes and compounding are particularly interesting to me. In fact, I see them as two sides of the same coins really. (If any linguist gets mad at this blasphemy, I will only listen to your complaints if you can come up with an acceptable definition of the word "word" — otherwise, keep your thoughts to yourself)

This is not going anywhere. At what point do I get to the actual exploration of suffixes? Do I really have to endure through these long-winded explanations and rationalizations of why I'm doing what I'm doing? Honestly it's just a fun linguistic experiment and I'm curious where it'll take me. That's that.

The main thing I actually *do* want to consider are the aspects of productive term-making that already exist within english, this is important as it will help my new vocabulary-making system to be at least partially-understandable to the outside observer and more easily learnable as it is based off new structures.

And one other thing to note: The reason I'm going to delve deep into prefixes and suffixes. Simply inventing new words for concepts is useful, but as I am exploring language as a "way of seeing", I don't just want new words but also the tools for exploring new ideas in general. Instead of a single word that expands what you can think by a small amount in one direction, exploring productive suffixes multiplies your existing vocabulary! It means you can apply these rules to any word which you already know. To me that is incredibly fascinating...

And without further ado:

## Observations

* `-space` is an interesting suffix/compound word as it denotes either the area of something or all possible variations and possibilities
	* area: `mindspace`, `thoughtspace`, `parkspace`
	* possibilities: `problem space` (could be either!), `design-space`, `idea-space`
* productive suffixes that make sense to us
	* `-ception`: inception/recursion or being related to perception
	* `-scape`: similar to `-space`, but whereas space feels bounded, scape feels like it stretches out infinitely in all directions (it could also refer to an ambient space if you take the metaphor of "soundscape" instead of "landscape")
		* interestingly, since `landscape` is also a verb, we may consider using any word formed with a `-scape` suffix as being able to be used as a verb as well?
			* `ideascaping`, `spacescaping`, `designscaping`, `wordscaping`
				* Exactly what do these mean now?
				* I think `wordscaping` feels a little like what I'm doing now. If you think of "landscaping" as "shaping the landscape", therefore "wordscaping" would be "shaping the wordscape"
					* So `wordcrafting` or `wordshaping` might refer to exploring individual words, `wordscaping` is more of shaping the landscape of all possible words — developing new grammar, suffixes, etc.
	* `-mas`: this turns any word into a christmas-like holiday
		* `doormas`, `lampmas`, `greenmas`, `walkmas`
			* as you can see, it seems to matter little what part of speech the word came from originally
* just about any words can be compounded/suffixed onto each other, some thoughts:
	* a word (A) that comes before another (A B) might specify/narrow down the possibility space of B (if it is a broad category / prototype), or it may act as some other type of modifier (in the case of `anti-` for example) or lens
		* ah yes, essentially it is a lens through which to look at the next word
	* a word (B) that comes after another (A B) drills down into specificities, getting to the specific object or idea you wish to convey
	* words can be chained as many times as you like (as long as it is still understandable) where every preceding word acts as a lens for the word after it
	* this leads to constructions like `booktrance` (the trance you enter when deeply reading and losing track of time), or `roomcornerfeel` (the feeling of being in the corner of the room)
* I am particularly interested in developing ways of speaking about the relationships between different things as part of my research practice
	* One reason for this is that exploring psychological phenomena or any kind of subjective experiences is very difficult with normal language! We simply don't have the right words or vocabulary not only to communicate but also to be able to see and understand the various psychological effects of things around us
		* What, for example, is the psychology of chairs? or of reading books?
* you could talk about the relationships between thing by simply pairing them together, like `chair-table`, though adding a suffix can help to highlight that this is a relationship and not a compounding word — so instead we might think of the `chair-table-ship` (where `-ship` is derived from `relationship`)
	* for the relationship between two of the same object (`chair-chair-ship`), I can see shortening it down to just `ch-chair`, doubling the first phoneme of the word to indicate the relationship between two of them
		* `ch-chair-positioning-space` would be the space of all possible positionings (/positioning relationship between) of two chairs (within a room likely, but that is contextual)
		* `b-book-trance` the trance of going between reading two books?
* `-vec` could also be a useful suffix in terms of applying the relationship between two words to other words, or to put it more succinctly: word vectors! This allows for two words to make a distinction between things that can become a lens through which you look at other things.
	* `house-home-vec` which is roughly equal to `brain-mind-vec` and `space-place-vec`, and given that these pairs of concepts are very self-similar it highlights the perception of coziness or closeness to a particular thing being specified (like how anything can be called a *house* but only *our house* is truly "home")
	* the general template for using `-vec` in relation to another thing can be something along the lines of `the X-Y-vec of Z is ...`, like `the house-home-vec of space is place`
* `-posed` (coming from juxtaposed) could be an interesting suffix for denoting things being within the vicinity of other things (or maybe `-near`?)
	* `the chair-posed lamp`, `the chair-near lamp`
	* `door-posed-space` meaning the space of all possible things which might be positioned next to or near a door
	* `action-posed-space` the space of all possible actions that might come within the vicinity of another action
	* `now-posed-space` roughly equal I think to my concept of `possibility-space`, I'd think of these two concepts as synonyms here
* `-tainment` makes anything into a kind of entertainment
* `-candy` or `-porn` often seem to refer to categories of things (usually images of things) that are particularly satisfying or pleasing to look at?
	* `earthporn`, `eyecandy`, `architectureporn` for some examples
* *if a man was to examine five hundred different wines, he would hardly find two of them that had precisely the same taste. The same thing holds in cheese, and in many other things. Yet, of five hundred different tastes in cheese or wine, we can hardly describe twenty, so as to give a distinct notion of them to one who had not tasted them* ([Thomas Reid](https://journals.openedition.org/estetica/1395?lang=it#ftn25))
	* Possibly relevant to this exploration of words is *taste*. We don't have very accurate ways of describing taste: sweet, salty, sour, umami...
		* This is about as crude as trying to describe things around you with only the terms of earth, water, fire, and air — very difficult indeed!
	* Interesting is the "wine vocabulary" that has developed, describing tastes as "woody", "fruity", or using a variety of other metaphors — though it seems quite rare for any of these pieces of vocabulary to enter everyday speech...
	* “sharp”, “lively”, “full”, “heady”, “clean”, “smooth”, “hot”, “fruity”, “astringent”, “bitter”, and “earthy” — some of the wine-tasting vocabulary of the 19th century
	* "*What the 19th and early 20th century did witness was the elaboration of a way of talking about wine which had some precedent in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, but which developed in a serious way in the Victorian and Edwardian periods. That was a way not so much of describing individual wines but of evoking their characteristics and their effects on the drinker – especially by way of literary allusion83. Poets, and those of a poetic frame of mind, did this routinely. Writing to his brother and sister-in-law in 1819, John Keats announced:*"
		* "*For really’t is so fine – it fills one’s mouth with a gushing freshness – then goes down cool and feverless – then you do not feel it quarrelling with your liver – no, it is rather a Peacemaker, and lies as quiet as it did in the grape; then it is as fragrant as the Queen Bee, and the more ethereal Part of it mounts into the brain, not assaulting the cerebral apartments like a bully in a bad-house looking for his trull and hurrying from door to door bouncing against the wainstcoat, but rather walks like Aladdin about his own enchanted palace so gently that you do not feel his step. Other wines of a heavy and spirituous nature transform a Man to a Silenus: this makes him a Hermes – and gives a Woman the soul and immortality of Ariadne, for whom Bacchus always kept a good cellar of claret…*"
	* "Robert Louis Stevenson coined the aphorism for this way of talking: «Wine», he said, «is bottled poetry»"
		* This gets, I think, to a fundamental aspect of how we can use language to communicate complex or internal states. In failing to grasp for descriptive objective language for the subjectivity of taste, one must fall back to subjective experience, poetry, as these fruitful imaginings can give you a hint into the experience of the taste rather than the taste itself.
	* **Describing** vs. **Evoking**
	* "*She judged that, when “novice tasters” claim that they “cannot smell anything”, what they are actually saying is that they haven’t the words to designate the categories of experience. The Wine Wheel is meant to give them the categories and the words at the time: it is, therefore, what might be called an **intersubjectivity engine**.*"
		* I like this term: **intersubjectivity engine**
		* This points also to the core problem that I am trying to explore, I "cannot smell anything" if I lack the words to describe what I am smelling — it makes sense then that I cannot see if I lack the words to describe what I am seeing?
			* There are so many things related to taste outside of flavor as well. What are my design tastes for example? how must I describe them? 

### Techniques for position-manipulation

*Different ways of transitioning from one part of speech to another*

* `-ing` can be used to make verbs, but there are lots of edge cases!
* `-age` can be used in a lot of cases to make verbs into nouns, e.g. `spread` -> `spreadage`
	* `there's not enough heatage` vs `there's not enough heat`
		* the former feels like it is referring to the process of heating (like the moments in which a heater is actually heating) whereas the latter refers specifically to the resulting temperature without reference to the process involved in arriving at said temperature

### Interesting lenses

* `book-trance`, using `-trance` here can then be applied to just about anything to indicate some kind of flow state of interaction: `computer-trance`, `work-trance`, `dishes-trance`, `social-media-trance`, `scroll-trance`, `writing-trance`, and this is much more flexible than `flow state` which is usually only used in terms of productivity
* adding `-space` to the end of anything is a very useful lens for imagining the space of all possible variations or possibilities of a thing, I am starting to find myself using this all the time
* adding `thought-`, `mind-`, `mental-`, or `-feel` can be useful entrypoints for exploring the psychology and ways we think about, interact, or feel about the things around us
