Language exists in a strange kind of equilibrium, in a balance of the number of words the average person can use and understand.

I've been thinking lately about research methods, and the thoughts I can or cannot think with the language I use.

Critics of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis say (laughably) that language does not affect thought, that everything which we have words for can be independently conceptualized without the existence of those words. What a load of rubbish. Have these people never coined their own word before? have they never been playfully creative with language in any way whatsoever? I have personally experienced many moments where a word I've made up for myself has sparked thoughts or ideas that I would not have had without it.

Yes, I can communicate those thoughts to someone without needing whatever specialized vocabulary I've created for myself, and theoretically I could also have had those thoughts independently of the word itself. But it's also theoretically possible for all the molecules in your body to spontaneously teleport to the moon. What's special about new vocabulary is that they get us closer to the precipice of unexplored ideas, it becomes easier to be pushed over that eureka threshold.

It also clearly doesn't take into consideration that language is the lens through which we see the world. The colours and shapes you see in front of your eyes don't *mean* anything unless you can understand what you're seeing. Humans, unlike animals, have the ability to augment their own perception of the world through use of language.


There seems to be a fear of new words. Maybe it's always been there, but certainly been exacerbated by modern technology. (it's also interesting that we're in a time where more people are literate than ever but the average vocabulary in north america has been steadily declining for a while). There is a kind of blind trust in dictionaries as a source of truth, we celebrate authors who invented words long ago (wow, good job shakespeare) but we seem afraid to extend or play with language in the present.

In a sense I want to experiment with an anti-1984, instead of simplifying english to limit the thoughts people can think — in what ways can we extend english, potentially in ways that are still comprehensible to people who are familiar with existing words?


Suffixes and compounding are particularly interesting to me. In fact, I see them as two sides of the same coins really. (If any linguist gets mad at this blasphemy, I will only listen to your complaints if you can come up with an acceptable definition of the word "word" — otherwise, keep your thoughts to yourself)

This is not going anywhere. At what point do I get to the actual exploration of suffixes? Do I really have to endure through these long-winded explanations and rationalizations of why I'm doing what I'm doing? Honestly it's just a fun linguistic experiment and I'm curious where it'll take me. That's that.

The main thing I actually *do* want to consider are the aspects of productive term-making that already exist within english, this is important as it will help my new vocabulary-making system to be at least partially-understandable to the outside observer and more easily learnable as it is based off new structures.

And one other thing to note: The reason I'm going to delve deep into prefixes and suffixes. Simply inventing new words for concepts is useful, but as I am exploring language as a "way of seeing", I don't just want new words but also the tools for exploring new ideas in general. Instead of a single word that expands what you can think by a small amount in one direction, exploring productive suffixes multiplies your existing vocabulary! It means you can apply these rules to any word which you already know. To me that is incredibly fascinating...

And without further ado:

## Observations

* `-space` is an interesting suffix/compound word as it denotes either the area of something or all possible variations and possibilities
	* area: `mindspace`, `thoughtspace`, `parkspace`
	* possibilities: `problem space` (could be either!), `design-space`, `idea-space`
* productive suffixes that make sense to us
	* `-ception`: inception/recursion or being related to perception
	* `-scape`: similar to `-space`, but whereas space feels bounded, scape feels like it stretches out infinitely in all directions (it could also refer to an ambient space if you take the metaphor of "soundscape" instead of "landscape")
		* interestingly, since `landscape` is also a verb, we may consider using any word formed with a `-scape` suffix as being able to be used as a verb as well?
			* `ideascaping`, `spacescaping`, `designscaping`, `wordscaping`
				* Exactly what do these mean now?
				* I think `wordscaping` feels a little like what I'm doing now. If you think of "landscaping" as "shaping the landscape", therefore "wordscaping" would be "shaping the wordscape"
					* So `wordcrafting` or `wordshaping` might refer to exploring individual words, `wordscaping` is more of shaping the landscape of all possible words — developing new grammar, suffixes, etc.
	* `-mas`: this turns any word into a christmas-like holiday
		* `doormas`, `lampmas`, `greenmas`, `walkmas`
			* as you can see, it seems to matter little what part of speech the word came from originally
* just about any words can be compounded/suffixed onto each other, some thoughts:
	* a word (A) that comes before another (A B) might specify/narrow down the possibility space of B (if it is a broad category / prototype), or it may act as some other type of modifier (in the case of `anti-` for example) or lens
		* ah yes, essentially it is a lens through which to look at the next word
	* a word (B) that comes after another (A B) drills down into specificities, getting to the specific object or idea you wish to convey
	* words can be chained as many times as you like (as long as it is still understandable) where every preceding word acts as a lens for the word after it
	* this leads to constructions like `booktrance` (the trance you enter when deeply reading and losing track of time), or `roomcornerfeel` (the feeling of being in the corner of the room)
* I am particularly interested in developing ways of speaking about the relationships between different things as part of my research practice
	* One reason for this is that exploring psychological phenomena or any kind of subjective experiences is very difficult with normal language! We simply don't have the right words or vocabulary not only to communicate but also to be able to see and understand the various psychological effects of things around us
		* What, for example, is the psychology of chairs? or of reading books?
* you could talk about the relationships between thing by simply pairing them together, like `chair-table`, though adding a suffix can help to highlight that this is a relationship and not a compounding word — so instead we might think of the `chair-table-ship` (where `-ship` is derived from `relationship`)
	* for the relationship between two of the same object (`chair-chair-ship`), I can see shortening it down to just `ch-chair`, doubling the first phoneme of the word to indicate the relationship between two of them
		* `ch-chair-positioning-space` would be the space of all possible positionings (/positioning relationship between) of two chairs (within a room likely, but that is contextual)
		* `b-book-trance` the trance of going between reading two books?
* `-vec` could also be a useful suffix in terms of applying the relationship between two words to other words, or to put it more succinctly: word vectors! This allows for two words to make a distinction between things that can become a lens through which you look at other things.
	* `house-home-vec` which is roughly equal to `brain-mind-vec` and `space-place-vec`, and given that these pairs of concepts are very self-similar it highlights the perception of coziness or closeness to a particular thing being specified (like how anything can be called a *house* but only *our house* is truly "home")
	* the general template for using `-vec` in relation to another thing can be something along the lines of `the X-Y-vec of Z is ...`, like `the house-home-vec of space is place`
* `-posed` (coming from juxtaposed) could be an interesting suffix for denoting things being within the vicinity of other things (or maybe `-near`?)
	* `the chair-posed lamp`, `the chair-near lamp`
	* `door-posed-space` meaning the space of all possible things which might be positioned next to or near a door
	* `action-posed-space` the space of all possible actions that might come within the vicinity of another action
	* `now-posed-space` roughly equal I think to my concept of `possibility-space`, I'd think of these two concepts as synonyms here
* `-tainment` makes anything into a kind of entertainment
* `-candy` or `-porn` often seem to refer to categories of things (usually images of things) that are particularly satisfying or pleasing to look at?
	* `earthporn`, `eyecandy`, `architectureporn` for some examples
* perhaps taste could provide an interesting avenue for thinking about developing vocabulary for subjective experience?
	* *if a man was to examine five hundred different wines, he would hardly find two of them that had precisely the same taste. The same thing holds in cheese, and in many other things. Yet, of five hundred different tastes in cheese or wine, we can hardly describe twenty, so as to give a distinct notion of them to one who had not tasted them* ([Thomas Reid](https://journals.openedition.org/estetica/1395?lang=it#ftn25))
		* Possibly relevant to this exploration of words is *taste*. We don't have very accurate ways of describing taste: sweet, salty, sour, umami...
			* This is about as crude as trying to describe things around you with only the terms of earth, water, fire, and air — very difficult indeed!
		* Interesting is the "wine vocabulary" that has developed, describing tastes as "woody", "fruity", or using a variety of other metaphors — though it seems quite rare for any of these pieces of vocabulary to enter everyday speech...
		* “sharp”, “lively”, “full”, “heady”, “clean”, “smooth”, “hot”, “fruity”, “astringent”, “bitter”, and “earthy” — some of the wine-tasting vocabulary of the 19th century
		* "*What the 19th and early 20th century did witness was the elaboration of a way of talking about wine which had some precedent in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, but which developed in a serious way in the Victorian and Edwardian periods. That was a way not so much of describing individual wines but of evoking their characteristics and their effects on the drinker – especially by way of literary allusion83. Poets, and those of a poetic frame of mind, did this routinely. Writing to his brother and sister-in-law in 1819, John Keats announced:*"
			* "*For really’t is so fine – it fills one’s mouth with a gushing freshness – then goes down cool and feverless – then you do not feel it quarrelling with your liver – no, it is rather a Peacemaker, and lies as quiet as it did in the grape; then it is as fragrant as the Queen Bee, and the more ethereal Part of it mounts into the brain, not assaulting the cerebral apartments like a bully in a bad-house looking for his trull and hurrying from door to door bouncing against the wainstcoat, but rather walks like Aladdin about his own enchanted palace so gently that you do not feel his step. Other wines of a heavy and spirituous nature transform a Man to a Silenus: this makes him a Hermes – and gives a Woman the soul and immortality of Ariadne, for whom Bacchus always kept a good cellar of claret…*"
		* "Robert Louis Stevenson coined the aphorism for this way of talking: «Wine», he said, «is bottled poetry»"
			* This gets, I think, to a fundamental aspect of how we can use language to communicate complex or internal states. In failing to grasp for descriptive objective language for the subjectivity of taste, one must fall back to subjective experience, poetry, as these fruitful imaginings can give you a hint into the experience of the taste rather than the taste itself.
		* **Describing** vs. **Evoking**
		* "*She judged that, when “novice tasters” claim that they “cannot smell anything”, what they are actually saying is that they haven’t the words to designate the categories of experience. The Wine Wheel is meant to give them the categories and the words at the time: it is, therefore, what might be called an **intersubjectivity engine**.*"
			* I like this term: **intersubjectivity engine**
			* This points also to the core problem that I am trying to explore, I "cannot smell anything" if I lack the words to describe what I am smelling — it makes sense then that I cannot see if I lack the words to describe what I am seeing?
				* There are so many things related to taste outside of flavor as well. What are my design tastes for example? how must I describe them? If I see something I like or dislike, how can I describe the taste of that thing?
					* Or in architecture, I am reminded of Christopher Alexander's exploration into the concept of "life", which itself seems one kind of taste of looking at, seeing, and reacting to some image, thing, or piece of architecture
		* *The _idea_ and _aura_ of objectivity – if not its actual attainment – are crucial to modern descriptive wine language. Many wine drinkers are now evidently drawn to language which picks out real constituents, substances which are thought of as the scientifically-warranted material causes of subjective experiences. The complexity of subjective experience is then treated as the aggregate of its taste – and smell – relevant constituents, and it is those constituents that we think, or hope, to pick out by descriptors such as asparagus, fig paste, or peach skin. We may understand that there are problems in concluding that we have thereby achieved _objectivity_, but there is something about the _idea_ of objectivity that is central to the historical appearance, and the cultural role, of this way of talking about wine tastes and smells.*
			* In the realm of psychological experience, outside of that of poetry, there seems to be a strong adherance to scientifically-studied behaviours (to varying levels of accurateness, the core pervading desire is that there is some kind of scientific seed no matter whether the actual idea may be wrong or completely disproven).
			* This also makes me think, to what extent can we describe emotions in terms of its relevant constituents or "chemical properties". Like triggering us to feel in particular parts of our body, or characterizing based off dopamine levels or different kinds of neurotransmitters? Would this be at all helpful or simply limiting for use in describing such subjective internal states?
			* *What was needed was a straightforward, demystified, referential language that described what a wine _was really like_, and that apparently referred its taste and smell to constituents that were _really in_ the wine. Such a language would be the opposite of poetry; it would be at once scientific and democratic.*
				* If objectivity is that of analytic description, and subjectivity is closer to that of poetry, and these two are opposite to each other — then how could my pursuit of new vocabulary be thought?
					* On one level it is incredibly analytical, attempting to find coherent ways for describing and analysing the things and relationships between things around us
					* But on another level it is quite poetic, both creating new imaginings, new metaphors, and delving into interesting subjective experiences! It expands my vocabulary for expression and gives new lenses for seeing the world
					* As such, objectivity and subjectivity seem in a strange way co-dependent of each other — like yin and yang...
		* *That generates a paradox: in order to face choice alone, people look for guidance. Not to a friend or to a merchant or to the wine steward of their club, but to authority sources who they may not know but who display the emblems of disinterestedness. **Many of us evidently seek to outsource our taste, to shape our subjectivity through the inaccessible subjectivity of others**. And it remains to our outsources to tell us that the thing is impossible*
			* Wow, that succinctly describes so much! "Many of us evidently seek to outsource our taste, to shape our subjectivity through the inaccessible subjectivity of others"
			* Isn't that true though? Whether design, architecture, or wine-tasting, we often shape our own taste not through deep thought of our own but through looking to respected experts on "taste" in each respective discipline
* `-smanship` can be used to give an air of the `craftsmanship` of something
	* `winesmanship`, `booksmanship`, `bedsmanship`, `doorsmanship`, `websitesmanship`
	* interestingly this could almost be thought of through my existing rule framework where `-ship` denotes the relationship between two things
		* thus `craftsmanship` is, in a way, the relationship between `craft` and `man`
* `-dom` refers to the "domain of ...", but where `kingdom` refers to the domain of a king more in the sense of land, words like `stardom` or `chefdom` are closer to referring to the state of being a `star` or a `chef`
	* can you form words like `bookdom` or `chairdom` then? if so, what do these mean?
	* there are also states like `boredom`, the state of being bored
	* wikitionary refers to four usages of the `-dom` suffix
		* 1. Forming nouns denoting the condition or state of the suffixed word.
			* `boredom`, `freedom`, `martyrdom`, `stardom`
		* 2. Forming nouns denoting the domain or jurisdiction of the suffixed word.
			* `Christendom`, `fiefdom`, `kingdom`, `Saxondom` 
		* 3. Forming nouns — usually nonce words — denoting the set of all examples of the suffixed word
			* `catdom`, `dogdom`, `furrydom`, `gothdom`, `wingdom`
		* 4. (fandom slang) Forming nouns denoting the fandom of the suffixed word. 
			* `Potterdom`, `stfdom`
	* in some ways I find the meaning of `-dom` relatively predictable here, and that it's meaning of `domain` naturally leads into all these various definitions (even to some extent the fandoms!)
		* you could imagine `boredom` as being `the domain of being bored`, or aka the state of being bored
		* the third definition kind of makes sense but I don't think I'll use it much given that I usually use `-space` to denote the space of all possible examples of something (though `-dom` helps to denote existing variations?)
* while not often seen :sad-face:, writing words within colons makes us (or me at least) interpret what is written as an emoji — or rather, something *emotive*
	* potentially :smiles: this could be used as markup to make text more expressive :yay:
		* :heh: :woo:
* `-hood` refers to a more temporal state of being, like `childhood` or `adulthood`
* ***The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes**, in seeing the universe with the eyes of another, of hundreds of others, in seeing the hundreds of universes that each of them sees.* (Marcel Proust)
* `-ward` could be particularly useful especially when positioning words along axes
	* if we have `chair-table-nuum` then it allows us to talk about `chairward` and `tableward` as the directions along this axis
* `... v ...` could be used in specifying a graph of multiple axes
	* `X v Y` would just be basic coordinate space
	* `Happiness v time` would be referring to one's happiness over time
	* `abstractness v usefulness v time` could refer to the abstractness and usefulness of words over time (as a 3-dimensional space)
	* `cozyiness v chair-sofa-vec-nuum`, here we can see how we might be able to turn any `-vec` into an axis `-nuum` which can then be used in a graph `... v ...`. Essentially the continuum then is the magnitude of the vector being applied!
* You could easily apply word-vectors simply using mathematical language like `door plus chair-sofa-vec` (alternately `chair-sofa-vec door` to use it as a lens, but this might be more confusing)
* `-factor` is useful pinpointing a property of something that is particularly important to the experience of that thing, particularly in reference to some property of malleability of the material
	* `squish-factor`, `cozy-factor`, `crunch-factor`, `squelch-factor`
* `-dynamics`, the (changing) relationship between two things
	* `chair-table-dynamics`, `hu-human-dynamics`, `social-dynamics` (social already refers to a set of relations?)
	* could be shortend to `-dyn` in some situations?
* `-flux` to denote something that is the state of constant change, implying a dynamic and everchanging state (a state of continuous change or fluidity of a concept)
	* `mind-flux`, `social-flux`, `flux-space`, `space-flux`, `psycho-flux`
	* `identity-flux` could represent the ongoing evolution and transformation of one's sense of self
		* we're always in a kind of identity-flux
* `inter-` emphasizing a connection or in-betweenness of a single concept
	* `inter-culture` (/`inter-cultural`)
* `intra-` inside
* `meta-` describes a higher, more abstract level of a concept. For example `meta-emotion` could refer to the emotions we feel about our emotions or emotional states
* `-scope` indicating a perspective or viewpoint centered on that concept. For instance, `eco-scope` could represent a viewpoint that considers the environmental implications of an action or decision
	* `perspective-scoping`, or just `scoping` in this context could refer to seeking out different viewpoints from which to understand
* `-web` signifying the intricate network of connections and relationships that surround something. (similar to `-net`)
	* `knowledge-web` could denote the interconnected nature of information, ideas, and expertise
* `-nexus` a focal point or hub that connects various elements or ideas. A `tech-nexus` could indicate a central point where technological innovations, advancements and ideas converge
* Recursive phrases: using self-referential phrases to evoke a sense of depth or complexity, such as `dreams within dreams` or `stories within stories`, these recursive expressions can prompt reflection and curiosity about the layers of meaning that underlie our experiences (GPT-generated, but this is very similar to my own usage of `-ception`, `dreamception`, or `storyception` has essentially the same meaning here)
* `-sphere` denotes an encompassing multidimensional space where a concept exists and operates
	* a `mind-sphere` could represent the expansive realm of thoughts, ideas and mntal processes
	* `cogni-sphere` could represent the entirety of one's cognitive experience
* `-dapt` the ability to or action of adapting something
	* `eco-dapt` might describe an ecosystem's ability to adjust to environmental changes
* `-polar` **signifies the existence of multiple, contrasting aspects or poles within a concept**
	* `mood-polar` could describe a person experience a wide range of conflicting emotions
* infix `-di-` between two words or parts of a compound word, this infix could signify a dual nature or balance between opposing forces. For example `love-di-hate` might describe the complex interplay between love and hate in certain situations (GPT-generated, but I like the concept. I don't think `di` is the best syllable to use in this context however because it sounds too close to `the`)
* `preter-` to describe something beyond or transcending the ordinary
	* `preterhuman`, `preternatural`, `preterlove`
* infix `-tide-` to represent the cyclical nature of a phenomenon, inserted within a word, e.g. `emo-tide-tional` for emotions that ebb and flow like the tide
	* similarly could be done with `-tide`, `emotion-tide`
	* or `-cycle`, `-seasons`
* `-quilt` to express a patchwork or mosaic of diverse elements
	* `culturequilt` for the complex tapestry of cultural influences
* `perma-` to express some kind of permanence of a concept
* the problem is that there can be almost any number of suffixes and prefixes, however exploring them in this way still holds useful — particularly in discovering and adapting (lexidapt) to using new words in one's writing and **thought processes**
	* a lot of these are like lenses, they might not be how you use language in the day-to-day, they are a kind of preter- or meta-language that lets you go beyond the ordinary language you use to describe the world
	* a useful technique could be to try to describe things around you from new perspectives (scoping) using the new vocabulary that you're experimenting with
* one of the next avenues of exploration that I want to delve into (and I think this might be useful to my overall goal of being able to better describe the psychological and subjective effects of things) is to explore the ways in which we can describe emotional states and the transitions between them
	* `-polar`, `-cycle`, `-factor`, `-trance`, `-sickness`
	* `internal-reality-rift`, `desiredreality-reality-rift`
	* `cognitive`, `social`, `physical`, `transcendent / existential`
		* `cognitive euphoria`
		* `social euphoria`
		* `physical euphoria`
		* `transcendent euphoria`
	* the feeling you get thinking about some past experience
		* `memory-feel`
	* a kind of sadness of feeling you haven't accomplished enough in life
		* `progress-sickness`, `growth-swamp`, `slowth-pain`, `couldbe-pang`
	* inner reality, desired reality, actual reality, possible branching reality (branching at some point in the past), possible branching reality (at some point in the future)
		* `self-reality`, `inner-reality`, `desiredom`, `desire-space`, `emotional-multidimensionality`
	* the existence of another person/thing that might be in your way (anger?), or have something that you want (envy)
	* the level of possibility, ability to turn your desired reality into actuality
	* neutrality (neutreality) is when you have little issue turning your desired reality into reality or you do not have any particularly strong desires at the moment, most emotions seem to arise out of some kind of discrepency
		* but then how would you describe empathy? emotional-mirroring?
	* one of the difficulties of specifying exact emotions is that there are many sources of emotion, and reasons why we might feel a particular thing — and rarely do we strongly reflect why we feel a certain way

### Techniques for position-manipulation

*Different ways of transitioning from one part of speech to another*

* `-ing` can be used to make verbs, but there are lots of edge cases!
* `-age` can be used in a lot of cases to make verbs into nouns, e.g. `spread` -> `spreadage`
	* `there's not enough heatage` vs `there's not enough heat`
		* the former feels like it is referring to the process of heating (like the moments in which a heater is actually heating) whereas the latter refers specifically to the resulting temperature without reference to the process involved in arriving at said temperature

### Interesting lenses

* `book-trance`, using `-trance` here can then be applied to just about anything to indicate some kind of flow state of interaction: `computer-trance`, `work-trance`, `dishes-trance`, `social-media-trance`, `scroll-trance`, `writing-trance`, and this is much more flexible than `flow state` which is usually only used in terms of productivity
* adding `-space` to the end of anything is a very useful lens for imagining the space of all possible variations or possibilities of a thing, I am starting to find myself using this all the time
* adding `thought-`, `mind-`, `mental-`, or `-feel` can be useful entrypoints for exploring the psychology and ways we think about, interact, or feel about the things around us
