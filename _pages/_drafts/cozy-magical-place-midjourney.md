*Magical, cozy, place-like. Aspirational but... How do we get there? How do we design a tool that feels beautiful? that feels like a place, a community.*

There are broadly two things when people say something is like *magic*; either they don't understand it, or they are continually surprised and delighted by what they can do. We want the latter, a small set of powerful tools. Easy to understand but with a wealth of depth and possibility.

A tool also feels magical if it sparks joy to use. Little details. Loving details. Polishing the interactions to feel just right. For this you don't want web designers, you want game designers. Those who make games understand how to iteratively tweak and playtest until it feels *juuust* right.

Coziness in essence is about *being human*. A tool feels cozy if it feels like *someone* made it, and cares about the people who use it. 

What makes something feel like a place? This is more complex. If we want to be the place where aesthetic exploration happens...

- There needs to be a larger overall navigational structure for *spaces*, a kind of home page of the entire community (the sidebar doesn't feel like navigating a place...)
- Some sense of presence of other people
	- Active user counts on different *spaces*
	- Comments or some form of social interaction
- Some sense of presence of yourself
	- Personal "user" page




this would be fantastic

this feels ideal actually


Something I've struggled with conceptually is 

Gravitating towards #3 for sureâ€” from my perspective, our models, algorithms, data, these are the fundamental materials we're working with

Being closer to models and research (thus being in more direct contact with the underlying materials) feels almost necessary in shaping novel interfaces around it. And without it, I've begun to reflect, feels like trying to shape clay without being able to touch the clay itself.

A few weeks at least seems like it'd be really valuable! I think this would definitely help to be able to communicate and tinker with things at a more fundamental level, and better understand the system as a whole


Also re: a lab. We spoke about

Cool, yeah, that seems like a good starting place~

Also initially we spoke of starting a lab, and I haven't actively pursued this but been passively on the lookout for people whose skillsets might be a good fit. I spoke with [Samim](https://x.com/samim) last Friday and he felt to me like the perfect kind of candidate for a more experimental prototyping lab (or just as a hire in general). Very broad skillset, he's been at the intersection of AI/design since 2014, worked on some neural game engine stuff at Stadia (up the alley of world simulation?), and generally has good perspectives/vibes. I have the sense from our conversation that I could riff well with him on new ideas.

You say we can't spare a researcher, but if we were to bring on someone like him I could have someone to not only to collaborate and ideate with more directly, but also learn from on the ML side of things. 

Obviously wasn't a technical interview

I also spoke to someone recently

We spoke also before joining about starting a lab. I've had an eye out 

To reflect briefly, the design
