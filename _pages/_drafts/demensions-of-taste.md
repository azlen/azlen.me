Whether a connoisseur, writer, or designer, your skill is much a matter of developing and honing your taste.

Taste. Two directions. Irk and awe. [^awesome]

[^awesome]: If awesome and awful—while originally having similar meanings—have drifted to become antonyms, I wonder if there is some world where we might have the word "irkful" as the opposing counterpart to "irksome." I could imagine, for example, irkful denoting something which challenges your knowledge or assumptions, inviting you to learn or think more deeply about a topic — or simply anything which evokes deeper thought or understanding. A good lecture may be quite *irkful*.
