- Mapping everything out
	- Why is this not part of design education?
	- Connections to atomic design? How is it different?
		- Atomic design feels very templatized ...
- Systemic design
- Spiritually feel closer to game design
- Figma (and even some prototyping tools) feel "flat" or "dead"
- Map -> Iterate -> Coalesce
	- If you iterate in the wrong medium, you will miss the fundamental essence of what you need to be building
- Rapid prototyping
	- Allows you to prototype quickly
- Design journal
- Constraints and creativity exercises

A) You have a "thing" to circle around (focal point)
B) You want to explore a general "space" of possibility (need more practice with this to better understand it... design a game?) — I feel like there's a way you can generally explore and build up connections between ideas, but without a clear direction it's hard to iterate or really go anywhere with it?? it's maybe better to use this divergent exploration to help find foci which you then explore further in depth

I'm not a designer. 

I was never a designer.

I used to think of myself as a programmer until people started calling me a designer. Spiritually, I'm a game designer. In essence, I'm a systems designer.

Writing a song is a design process. Writing a book. Making a game. 

If you start with a word and then branch out to associations on that, and associations on that. Take words two or three associations out and start pulling them together. Like this you can write a song about a topic or feeling without ever stating the thing directly.

In some ways I feel like my design emerges or is "discovered", much like mathematics or physics. Am I really inventing anything new? It feels like putting together a puzzle— the image is already there, I just need to figure out how the pieces fit together into a coherent whole.

How do you write an essay about a topic without ever directly addressing the essence of the thing? Well, first I would need to figure out what the essence of this essay is... 

"Everything in the world is exactly the same" —Kanye West

What is my design process?

The problem is, I don't even know how to answer this question. It depends on so many things, and what I am making. And yet, there are probably similar patterns in all cases.

What is the essence?

Prototyping things, seeing how they feel

I am guided by intuition. By taste. I make things, and then play with them, and iterate on this.

We need to be in a tight feedback loop with our tools to be able to be truly creative.

If you can design systems, you can design anything.
Like, even deep AI research feels more like a "design" problem than anything else.
All research and innovation, materials science, all these things are knowledge and iteration guided by intuition.

Intuition guided by iteration.
Iterative intuition.
Intuitively iterating.

What feels good. What makes something feel good? How do you develop taste? How do you develop an intuition for what makes one thing feel better than another?

I've never deeply thought on how to develop an intuition before, it feels like something that has grown out of an entire life of prototyping and making things, of being self-guided and self-taught, of following every curiosity and rabbit hole until it began to feel like I was working towards something greater, something bigger.

Eight years ago I started to feel the sense that all my projects were connected. That everything I do, no matter how seemingly unrelated will always come back to become relevant.


There's an interesting metaphor here with limits. If a function cannot be evaluated at a particular point, you may still be able to calculate what it would be if you get closer and closer to that point. In the same way, mapping something out can allow you to take an unparseable idea and get closer and closer to it, circling around the essential concept, until you are able to more fully understand in it's complexity.

I feel like it would be worth prototyping Cardographer in preparation of this essay on my design process. It feels like it may help to explore the idea further and perhaps give an interesting way to explore or practice designing something in a similar way.

Both game design and industrial design involve making a lot of prototypes, sketches, and just trying things over and over again until they work really well — if you have a good teacher that is...
