Prompt from Matt: I think it'd be interesting for each of us to write and articulate what they imagine a space like this would be used for. That way we can share and compare which parts have overlap and see the differences as well

Perhaps write a design fiction!?

Using walkie-talkie to communicate with each other... a room of echoes... shelf of projects... vistors to the lab... raising the garage door... fresh croissants at the bakery across the street... we seek to create new tools, but also new stories... the physical world is increasingly intertwined with digital space... Emergence...

Postcard from the future

Written from the perspective of someone who was part of the (brief) lab, and is walking past the space reminiscing about their time? Or just someone who is there...
