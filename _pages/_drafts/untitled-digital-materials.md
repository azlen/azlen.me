The goal of software, more generally, ought to be to craft coherent mental maps in our mind; just like through exposure we learn to navigate our neighbourhood, or intuit complex grammar rules as a child without ever having to exert serious mental effort. And just as you can chain words together to craft new meaning, digital tools should be able to compose together to create new interfaces, or even entirely new digital mediums.

So while exploring a city lets you discover new places and better understand how to navigate the space around you; and exploring language lets you delve into new meanings and understand how to better translate thoughts into words; exploring software lets us translate those thoughts into action[^tft], it has the possibility to unlock entirely new mediums and forms of expression, let us do things we previously thought impossible.

At the heart of both the beauty and danger of computing is the promise of this little device that can do just about anything — as long as this _anything_ can be represented through lots of strings of letters and numbers and lists of things, which, it turns out, is quite a damn lot!

Computers turned out to be so useful in fact, that they’ve seeped into every aspect of our lives[^ai], from birth to death and all the little moments in-between that we sometimes call _life_; you aren’t really _you_ anymore unless you exist in the computer, a digital footprint, our lives broken down into abstractions and numbers. Oh, and they let us make cool spreadsheets, and powerpoint presentations, visualize 4d geometry, play games, compose music, communicate from far away, and express ourselves in every which way — even if your ideal form of expression is posting rude comments to internet strangers. It’s hard, I guess, to capture what computing really means. To me. To all of us. To the world. And well, the impossibility of capturing the infinitely vast space of possibility that computers have opened up to us makes it even harder for me to communicate just how small that possibility space really is.

It is like learning, upon understanding the concept of infinity, that there are different levels of infinity. Bigger infinities. So if I were to look upon computing, the internet, software, every tool, every moment of wonder, every drop of creativity that people channel through their screens, and if I were to say to you dear reader, “this, all this, is only a fraction of what is possible”, then you’ll respond “prove it”, and then I shrug and say “I’m trying” and that’s that.

If only such a statement could be proved just like we can prove the different levels of infinity, or those little geometric proofs for the pythagorean theorem from a single image.


One of my biggest roadblocks along this journey has been to communicate my vision. Because I often think of writing as a kind of distilled thought, so I ought, then, to be able to distill my thoughts into writing. With such a vision, I can only ever catch glimpses of it — yet my desire is to write about it in its totality.

I dream of a world in which everyone has agency, has control over their experience with computers, and the interfaces which they use. This of course, would be of little consequence to many people — but everybody, whether by trickle-down effects or as an active participant would benefit from it.



[^tft]: I often see much of the "tools for thought" space as misguided as it focuses so much on optimizing how we capture thoughts and exerts little effort into the computer can be a powerful collaborator in crafting creative artifacts. Do you want to sit in front of a computer thinking all day long, or turning thoughts into action? Tools for thought often sacrifices the latter.

[^ai]: Think about how computers, which are really good at jiggling around numbers have had such a pivotal impact on the world. Now imagine the developments in artificial intelligence, which, it turns out, if you create large enough networks that jiggle around numbers in a certain way you can start to be able to all the things with computers that computers, traditionally, have not been good at; and given that computers, as previously stated, are good for quite a damn lot — this should be decent enough reason panic)
