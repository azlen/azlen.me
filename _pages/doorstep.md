*The door creaks open with a welcoming light, taking off your shoes you place them on the shoe rack as you step inside...*

This page is a *digital shoe rack*, I invite you to pause for a moment, take a picture of your shoes, and send them to `shoes@azlen.me`, being sure to include both a picture and your name!
