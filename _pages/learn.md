As part of my research into effective forms and constraints for fostering generative spaces and learning groups, I've decided to revive my "learn with me" page to outline various groups or learning experiments and invite you to join me.

- **On the origins of scenius**: developing a pattern language on fostering generative spaces \[groups, communities, platforms\]
- **Table of contents reading club**: we only read the table of contents or skim headings in order to get a more intuitive sense for the structural building blocks or ways to construct an argument or narrative on a macro scale
- **Augmenting language**: exploring new vocabulary, affixes, structures, and shapes of meaning specifically to expand one's possible thoughtspace and see the world through new lenses

*Don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:contact@azlen.me) if any of these spark your interest. Always happy jam with new people!*
