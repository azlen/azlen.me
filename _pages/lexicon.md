[](){name="applied_science_fiction"}

Applied Science Fiction
~ See [Design Fiction](#design_fiction)

[](){name="artifacting"}

~ Creating an artifact together, whether story, essay, video, etc.

[](){name="checklist_education"}

Checklist Education
~ Teachers being required to teach “by the checklist” of curriculum that is set forth for them

[](){name="conductive_substrate"}

Conductive Substrate
~ Factor that enables the formation of new connections and relationships within an overall group or community.

~ *See:* [L#20](/quick-ideas/learning#20)

[](){name="conflerge"}

Conflerge
~ Two concepts which appear opposed to each other yet work towards the same idea

[](){name="design_fiction"}

Design Fiction
~ My approach to writing fiction to explore design spaces from a bottom-up, human-scale perspective. I also sometimes call this process [Applied Science Fiction](#applied_science_fiction)

[](){name="digital_body_language"}

Digital Body Language
~ The ability to non-verbally communicate, express yourself, or gesture in digital space. Often involves a virtual body or avatar. A *digital body language* does not have to exactly mirror the affordances we have in the real world and with our physical body, it only matters that it gives us the tools or multiple axes for expressing ourselves in different ways.

[](){name="expert_amnesia"}

Expert Amnesia
~ The tendency for an expert to have built up such large chunks of knowledge that they forget the path they took to get there

[](){name="explorative_interfaces"}

Explorative Interfaces
~ Interfaces that give us the tools to explore large realms of data and discover new thought spaces

[](){name="failure_machines"}

[](){name="fractal_wayfinding"}

Fractal Wayfinding
~ The idea that a city should ideally be made up of memorable places, both to serve as mental anchors and also to help build place identity—and that places need to be memorable at all scales from the small scale of buildings and streets to larger neighbourhoods and landmarks

[](){name="gateway_project"}

Gateway Project
~ A project that feeds into many other projects

[](){name="imagination"}

Imagination
~ Imagination is the ability to focus our attention on things that are not immediately present to our senses

[](){name="intimacy_gradient"}

Intimacy Gradient

[](){name="margon"}

Margon
~ Metaphorical-jargon, a natural way of conveying complex ideas without being completely unintelligable to the outside ear. For example a "mental anchor", or "reciprocal need", much of the meaning is already embedded into the words it contains.

[](){name="reciprocal_need"}

Reciprocal Need
~ The foundation of community, a community is formed and strengthened by having a reciprocal need for each other

[](){name="ruvurple"}

Ruvurple
~ A state of flow so powerful that it spreads to the people around you

[](){name="solastalgia"}

Solastalgia

[](){name="thoughtspace"}

Thoughtspace
~ The collection of thoughts and frame of mind around a particular idea or phrase

[](){name="transition_space"}

Transition Space
