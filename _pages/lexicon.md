Words, words, words. 

**Anticipant**: *An element of an interface that foreshadows what is about to happen if you take a certain action*

**Applied Science Fiction:** See "Design Fiction"

**Artifacting**: *Creating an artifact together, whether story, essay, video, etc.*

**Checklist Education**: *Teachers being required to teach “by the checklist” of curriculum that is set forth for them*

**Conflerge**: *Two concepts which appear opposed to each other yet work towards the same idea*

**Design Fiction:** *My approach to writing fiction to explore design spaces from a bottom-up, human-scale perspective. I also sometimes call this process "Applied Science Fiction"*

**Expert Amnesia**: *The tendency for an expert to have built up such large chunks of knowledge that they forget the path they took to get there*

**Explorative Interfaces:** *Interfaces that give us the tools to explore large realms of data and discover new thought spaces*

**Failure Machines**: *Schools should be failure machines, they should be spaces where it is safe to try something new, and spaces where you can learn from your failures*

**Fractal Wayfinding:** *The idea that a city should ideally be made up of memorable places, both to serve as mental anchors and also to help build place identity—and that places need to be memorable at all scales from the small scale of buildings and streets to larger neighbourhoods and landmarks*

**Gateway Project**: *A project that feeds into many other projects*

**Imagination**: *Imagination is the ability to focus our attention on things that are not immediately present to our senses*

**Intimacy Gradient:** *The idea of public spaces branching off naturally into smaller and more intimate spaces, at both the community level and of an individual home*

**Margon:** *Metaphorical-jargon, a natural way of conveying complex ideas without being completely unintelligable to the outside ear. For example a "mental anchor", or "reciprocal need", much of the meaning is already embedded into the words it contains.*

**Reciprocal Need:** *The foundation of community, a community is formed and strengthened by having a reciprocal need for each other*

**Ruvurple**: *A state of flow so powerful that it spreads to the people around you*

**Solastalgia**: *Homesickness for the place you're currently at*
