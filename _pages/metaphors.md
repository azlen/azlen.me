title: "Metaphors"

I just wanted to make a page of metaphors I liked. Thanks for stopping by!

CITY AS SOIL
~ The sense the the city is the ground from which we all may flourish. We are like plants, *laying down roots* in a place.
~ Unlike the prevalent `CITY AS AN ORGANISM` metaphor which sees the *city as alive*, the `CITY AS SOIL` metaphor recognize that the city *is not alive*, but it's the *people* who bring life to the city. It also recognizes this kind of cyclical process, just as a plant eventually dies and decomposes—enriching the soil for all those around it—there is a sense that people both benefit from and give back to the soil of a city.

CLASSROOM AS BOULDERING GYM
~ Bouldering gyms, in my mind, are fantastic learning environments: a mix of skill levels, problem-based learning, a friendly atmosphere where people chat about how to solve different challenges. This metaphor invokes a very different conception of classroom than we have today: one where people are all about the space solving problems, talking to each other
