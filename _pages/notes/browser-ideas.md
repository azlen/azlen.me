*Some rough unorganized ideas for browsers:*

- A browser where every website is a card you can drag around and stack
- A search engine where you are walking/surfing/flying around the globe and results relevant to your query pop up related to specific locations
- A browser where instead of moving your mouse, you move the webpage, first-person web browsing!
- A browser that disregards the rendering engine and instead scrapes structured data from webpages
- A spirit-world browser, instead of navigating to pages directly you train spirits to go out into the digital world and find the types of content you're looking for (by describing what you want or feeding them examples)
- A browser that is a journal, which is both a log and source of exploration
- A browser that is like an interactive-fiction game, instead of visiting websites they are described like places?
- A browser that is a single feed, you can subscribe to RSS feeds, website updates, pull in social network feeds, etc. everything you want is all in one single place
- A physical browser, using a thermal printer to print websites out
- A browser dungeon crawler? or roguelike?
	- Ads become random encounters??
- A browser that uses your phone's accelerometer to create a feeling like you're panning for gold
- A browser where you can only navigate by typing the thing you want to move to
- A browser that is like a comic
- A browser you can navigate with your voice
- Website dating game— tell it what you're looking for (your "search") and then swipe left and right on websites to find a match!
- A browser where any website you like becomes added into your internet spaced repetition system
- A browser that gives you quests, you go on treasure hunts to find answers to interesting questions
- A browser that only gives one website per day/hour and it is the same website for everybody!!
- Speed-reading optimized browser, ultra reader mode!
- Pokemon-Go-like browser where you must walk around the city along with your internet pokedex (bonus if your distance walked translates to the amount of distance you are able to scroll in your browser)
- Dreams browser, surfaces things from your history and new stuff it finds based on your interests— like a screensaver
- Reddit-only browser / search engine, ask a question and it will surface answers from various reddit threads
- A browser that is like a library? all the websites you visit get indexed somehow and organized into shelves that you can walk around?
- Browser MMO, with everyone interacting with a single browser session
- Spaced repetition browser (could be merged with the idea of websites as cards?)
