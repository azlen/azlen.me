One of my bigger [research questions](/notes/research-questions) is around how can we create better browsers?

My goal in this pursuit is not just to explore browsers, but to explore the future of computing in general. Most of our time is spent online, so exploring completely new ways of interacting with those digital spaces around us leads to a bigger vision than just "making a browser."

My current plan is, instead of making a single browser I will make a bunch of smaller browser experiments. These would be interesting experiments to try anyway, but packaging them and making them available to people to use will allow for feedback and further experimentation.
