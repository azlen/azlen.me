**Marissa** — Tools for **externalizing thought** / text-to-image (expressiveness, how this is the next gutenburg press) + collaborative & artistic potential

- In your introducton, it was mentioned "tools for externalizing thought" — I have some of my own associations with this but I'm curious, what do you mean by that?
- Do you think text-to-image (and beyond) will have an evolutionary effect on language? or perhaps lead us into new forms of communication entirely?


**Andrew** — what software + hardware can be built to make computing less distractive + exploring **new metaphors**

- Do you have any thoughts on new metaphors for computing?
- I have an experience of anti-distraction for myself where I composed lttle songs about whatever I'm currently working on. (honestly will be super cool in the near future if I could give a prompt to song-gpt and just start listening to an infinite playlist)
- one thing that draws me towards creating more malleable and modular software, is that it provides a viable path towards moving away from rectangular screens and towards more playful and explorative modes of computing — devices that can integrate with our systems in different ways...


**Adam W** — collaboration online / **things that feel like places**

*I asked Adam about how he runs the research lab, and I feel like the outcome of the question was useful to me! the way they structure around certain pivotal questions or projects, and those structured around bigger themes. I think that helped myself conceptualize running a lab better and also think about a learning platform potentially...*

- I've thought a lot about making things that feel like places, I'm curious the direction or angle you've come at this from? 
- In a dream world of computing, what does collaoboration look like to you?


**Linus** — how to build vision around tools for thought / how to becoem financially sustainable

- Why do you want tools for thought? what about tools for creativity?
- Do you think the focus on text is limiting to the tools for thought space?

**Ed** — cognitive science, **memory**, perception, techniques for getting to extreme states of consciousness, **tools for togetherness**

- Have you ever explored short-hand writing techniques? there's some I found in books from the 1800s that are beautiful, look very arabic-esque
- There's a particular experimental video that I found got me into an interesting state of consciousness — howver I wouldn't say extreme
- I'd also like to describe my experiences with hypnagogic dream states and see what his thoughts are on that
- You built memrise? if you did that all again, what would you be doing differently this time?


**Omar** — **the world becoming the interface** / embodied computing / **folk patterns of computing**

*Folk patterns! great prompt, what sort of folk patterns of interfaces have I encountered in the past?*

- folk patterns of computing
	- download a file from drive to upload to gmail
	- this might just be a me-thing, but I when writing longer messages I like to write all the messages first, and then I copy-paste to send one after the other— I'm worried that if I send the first message then the other person will respond before I fully finish my thought
- 



**Kevin K** — databases + decentralization + party lights :) inventive

*Lots of knowledge about satellites, other than that not too sure where to slot in conversation topics... he's also experimented with building programming languages?*




**Amjad** — **natural language as universal interface** / what does that enable / new types of languages?

*What to talk to Amjad about? he seems to have firmly placed himself in the camp of natural language interfaces and I haven't seen him talk about much else.*

- you're super excited about natural language as a universal interface — do you see these language models as sort of linguistic repls? or, how could they be made to capture a similar feeling?
	- Like I'm thinking in terms of that experiment Linus made, being able to blur and sample and get results. You could almost build out tons of different functions and ways of querying and shaping output from models / language models and query them in a repl-like way. Whether you're graphing data in different ways, generating lists, etc. a creative environment


**Paula** — the future of opera / digitization of older media - what is lost, what is gained / community games / **augmenting learning**

*I'm curious to explore the "augmented learning" and "community games", and there could potentially be some interesting questions around the digitization of older media*

- curious to hear your thoughts— there is a trend of films and tv-shows increasingly being set in ever-expanding "universes". The marvel universe, harry potter universe, etc. I see AI models in the medium to long term picking up this trend and taking it 200x further. Being able to explore worlds from novels, or walk around the fictional cities of old films or cartoons. Different modes of experiencing existing works of art and fiction — as well as a nearly infinite pool of comp-fictions of computer-generated stories and movies within these worlds. What do you think of that?
- I think "community games" was mentioned in your introduction yesterday, can you elaborate further on that?
- What aspects of "augmented learning" are you interested in?


**Anarupa** — what was your secondary + higher education like? what would you like to change? education + technology

- seeing education hubs as part of the future of learning -- both physically and digitally providing spaces and resources

**Brooke** — decentralized file-system + everything / front-end-only world

*Really interesting, think a lot of the stuff Brooke is building will be useful in terms of infrastructure for decentralized projects I want to build (like cozyroom). She seems to have a cached response for some of the stuff she's building, I'd be curious to dig deeper to some of the base motivations.*

- If you could pitch what you're working on using none of the words you normally use, or to an 80-year old, how would you describe it?


**Molly** — vision for future of computing / manifesto

*Molly is interested in publishing, working to create a digital-first magazine? If she wasn't in tech, perhaps be a photojournalist? Perhaps I could ask her questions about photography?*

- What did you learn from running mothminds?
- What interests you about photography?
- What drives your own passion for technology and the future of computing?


**Andy** — **creative environment** architecture / interface of devices. / what spurs our creativity?

*Andy is super kind! I don't know too much about what to talk to him about as he tends to communicate through denser terms like "creative environment" which might have a lot of more built-up meaning inside his mind. Perhaps to pick these ideas apart in different ways?*

- In the workshop (yesterday), do you think there were any major themes or ideas that were left out or overlooked as big "hamming questions" to drive forth the future of computing?
	-  personally I think "mental models" important
- What do you think about language models in creating creative environments? do you think they can be useful components in a personal design process?
- 

**Adam L** — whatever you're excited about

*What am I excited about? the future of computing! digital materials?*

- Tech trees :) digital materials, etc.

**Paul** — **Software that gives you agency**

*In my conversations with Paul I have talked about spatial interfaces, graph data structures, what other thoughts might I consider bouncing off him?*

- Pitch thoughts on transformation layer for computing

**Taylor** — **How we can change the metaphors of computing** / **place that feels like home**

- Have you thougth about or encountered better or interesting alternatives to the desktop metaphor for computing?
	- Personally I think about the "room" (bringing into a more cohesive universe of your digital "home" / environment)
- What would make a computing environment feel like home?
- The semantic fidget spinner was starting to make me think about, what if you had a fidget spinner that JUST acted as a scroll-wheel???

**Kevin** — gpt language interfaces - how to take into account future intentions...

- How would language models take into account future intentions?

**Maggie** — cultural, anthropological perspective of user-interactions / future interactions w/ language models

- what are new modes of interaction that language models will enable?
- have there been many anthropological-style studies on computer users / or even digital communities / cultures?
- Have you delved much into digital anthropology?

**Samantha** — how AI can work with you not replace you / what are your dreams for AI?

*I already asked her something along the lines of that question around dreams for AI but completely forget the result of the conversation. I think next time I should ask from the other angle of AI that works with you, and collaborative interaces.*

- what brings you to be interested in AI?
- how do you think collaboration with AI models will look like?

**Joe** — thinking about the materials that make up physical world — and the materials that make up the digital world

**Jared** — contexts for education / school

- what is learning? are there any really weird ways we can frame the concept of learning?

**Nicole** — video games + reality TV / voice interfaces (other video game)

- how do you fund your video game projects? I guess publishers?
