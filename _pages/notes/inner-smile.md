When you smile, are you really happy? sometimes I feel yes, other times perhaps a false facade; sometimes tricking others, sometimes even tricking myself. When I feel truly happy I find, it feels as if I'm smiling on the inside. I could be frowning, but if I'm smiling on the insideâ€” then I'm happy.
