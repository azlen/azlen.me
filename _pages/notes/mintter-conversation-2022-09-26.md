How to have meaningful discussions in a document?

discussions!! (are they separate?)
- star-structured document
	- base document, and query to it
	- reply to any document

discussions = backlinks (so far)

base document + queries (I'd like to know more about the latter)

editing vs publishing state

in the future, the user might be able to create the filter they want

scale of discussions:

cohesive discussion groups (where do you start these?)

knowledge (community organizer) theory:
- invites participants
- discussions happen
- synthesis of what has been discussed

another form of discussion:
- annotation of document...

**Mesh of messages(/documents) that construct knowledge space**

NEED TO SHOW IF SOMETHING IS EDITABLE / PUBLISHED?

having different views for conversations
