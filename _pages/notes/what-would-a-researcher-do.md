How often am I surrounded by a cloud of confusion, a dark shadow fueled by unconscious anxieties clouding my judgement. It is as if I have lost trust in myself, in my own process of making, that I have lost that inner passion, that [inner smile](/notes/inner-smile).

Perhaps it would be wise to imagine that which you aspire to be. Ask yourself in any moment, "what would a (highly effective) researcher do right now?" and follow any judgement that follows this line of thought. I want to explore the edges and possibilities of computing, but I also want to make things! I want to make things that people use! that people enjoy!

A researcher, also, might not always have 100% of a goal with their work. It's all about hypotheses and processes. You need to develop a good process, one that makes you happy and lets you answer the questions you want to answer. Then, progress towards your goals will come, with time.
