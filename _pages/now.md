Currently thinking about and dabbling with:

- Learning Japanese and experimenting with mnemonic techniques for effective remembering in preparation for an upcoming trip to Japan
- Working on documenting past projects and writing longer-form content on this website
- Playing around with animation and video-making, planning to begin publishing videos soon on my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@azlenelza)
- How can digital spaces be more playful and place-like?
- Exploring ways in which digital interfaces can be made more composable in such a way to augment the expressivity and agency of those who use them
