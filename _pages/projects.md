â€”

Documenting my projects is extremely difficult, I honestly don't know where to start. I have made hundreds of projects and experiments over the years, to document everything in detail could result in multiple full-length books.

Also, what counts as a project? Versus an experiment?

I think perhaps a project is something that is larger scale or can continue for a much longer length of time. For example coming up with an alternative way to play bananagrams might be an experiment, but the compilation of all these alternate modes of playing is an ongoing project.
