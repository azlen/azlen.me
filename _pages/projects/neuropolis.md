Maps give us space to ask our own questions, and the tools to find the solution. The distance between buildings affects our perception of the space, and whether we feel comfortable in it. My task is to embark on a journey through the city of today, and the minds of its inhabitantsâ€” so that we might, just maybe, see an inkling into the city of tomorrow.

How do we navigate the spaces around us? what's the difference between a *space* and a *place*? and what small interventions can we make in our own cities to make them better places? how does the very language we speak affect the ways our cities are shaped?

Neuropolis will be a series of writings, snippets, recordings, and fragments of the imagination exploring the intersection between cities and the mind.
