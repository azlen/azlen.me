All writing is collaborative. Whether you're collaborating with others, or simply collaborating with yourself. It is important that the interfaces we use to write give us the space to be free and experiment without feeling like we're stepping on someone's toesâ€” which, in my experience is what most collaborative writing tools feel like.

Even in my own writing I'll come to a crossroads. Writing three or four variations and cluttering up my workspace before I finally decide which one I like most. What if there was an interface that enabled this exploration by default? that embraced the writing process not as a linear journey but as a non-linear exploration?
