title: "Questions & Quandries"
---

I'm actually not quite so sure how to structure this page. *Even a single question* may lead to many others, can I perhaps distill my work down into a single guiding question and branch off from there?

*Of course I had to begin by asking a meta-question about my question page...*

Well just to start this off I'll list off some questions on my mind and see where this goes, I'll probably come back and restructure this later:

- How can we learn and explore the landscape of knowledge more effectively, together?
- How do we remember things, how do we forget?
- How are we affected by the spaces around us?
- How can we push technology beyond screens?
- Can we improve our fundamental social technologies? how we communicate with each other? the metaphors we use?
