<!--## #2: Cities are not alive

Cities are not alive, it is the people that make them feel alive. A city without people is a ghost city, a town without people is a ghost town. This metaphor between

## #2: Bottom-up design

Often cities are often planned top-down. Laying out streets, then buildings, then floor layouts, then interiors, etc. Designing anything from the top-down creates assumptions of all the lower levels. I haven't figured out the right way to frame this idea just yet, but top-down is like being focused on your destination, whereas bottom-up is like being focused on your journey without assuming you know where you'll end up...

I've been trying to explore different methods of designing from the bottom-up instead of top-down. Bottom-up design starts at the human scale and works up from there. Some examples of bottom-up design:

- **Writing short design-fictions**: If you're designing something as large as a city, or even simply a piece of software, writing a story can help force yourself to think from a human-scale through someone's perspective
- **Idea collages**: Instead of laying out the streets or buildings of a city, make a collage or mood board of all the kinds of places or activities you'd like to see around you. Kids playing in the park, open workshops, signboards with community activities, etc.
- **Quick idea journal**: Exactly what I'm doing now! Originally inspired by [Keita's Quick Ideas](https://www.glitchthegame.com/oddsandends/qis/), write up quick design thoughts and ideas (try to keep them short and succinct if possible) and give each one a number as you go to be able to reference back to past thoughts. By the time I've amassed a sufficient number of ideas (I'd say somewhere around 40 - 90, but it may vary) I start to feel like I can see the bigger picture- that somehow all the little ideas are like puzzle pieces of something larger.
- **Copy + Paste + Edit**: When designing in Figma I have a habit of copy-pasting the entire artboard every time I want to make even the smallest change. My first artboards are always ugly as hell but through iteratively making small changes over time it turns into something fantastic!

Reflecting on these different techniques, some patterns / key ideas:

- **Think on a human-scale**: storytelling, collaging, small quick ideas
- **High quantity of small iterations**: quick ideas, iterative design, enough small ideas over time lead to a better overall bigger picture

## #1: No Floor Space Ratio

Recently I spent 12 hours listening to a city council meeting on the "Future of South False Creek." Where our city's real-estate department (not planning department) was their fantastic plan to bulldoze the whole community where I grew up in order to build skyscrapers.

Something that has agitated me throughout the presentation and discussions was this "FSR" metric which is obtained by dividing the total floor space by the space of the lot. This does not include parks or streets but it **does** include the shared and communal spaces *inside* of our co-ops. It feels to me like FSR serves to maximize building density without respect to *community density*.

![Current FSR ratios across South False Creek](/images/false-creek-fsr-ratios.png)

I went delving into the history of South False Creek and found the [original development plan](/refs/odp-false-creek.pdf), which to my great surprise clearly stated:

> No Floor Space Ratio - The criteria set forth in the Official Development Plan shall be used for density and bulk controls instead of traditional floor space ratios.

Instead they lay out qualitative criterias rather than rather than quantitative ones. In other words: *how the space should feel, not what the numbers should be*.

This is my artistic rendition, the exact numbers are made up but it's close enough to being accurate to illustrate the point. From left to right: mid-density community of town-houses surrounding central courtyard, a low-density single-family home, and finally a condominium tower with a public park beside it. Because the shared space (park) of the tower is a public park it does not get counted as part of the FSR rating and thus leads to a much much higher floor space ratio.
