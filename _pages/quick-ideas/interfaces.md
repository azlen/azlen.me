## #? Intensity

Imagine if our digital tools had levels of intensity

If you can grab to drag-and-drop objects, what if you could power-grab to drag interface elements around? or use the circular saw to simply cut your desktop in half into two separate workspaces...

## #?: Icons of the Future

Kids growing up these days have never seen a floppy disk, yet in our digital landscape the floppy is signifies saving. It is simply much more iconic than any storage medium to succeed itâ€”can you imagine "save" being a CD, thumb drive, or SSD? 

Why do we even need a save icon at all? it's surprising these days if your device doesn't autosave all your work in the background. Perhaps we need to reframe the idea of "saving" altogether?

I think that icons are inherently metaphorical. We understand "saving" through the lens of a floppy disk, and we understand "deleting" through the lens of a trashcan. However I often wonder if we can shift these metaphors through which we understand technology. What if instead of a floppy disk we used an icon of a snowflake? changing the metaphor from saving to a limited storage space to freezing the state of a document at a particular point, perhaps noting a point you might want to come back to in the history of the document. I might want to "freeze" an essay, delete half the text and rewrite things, then go back to the last frozen state to recover the previous text.

This is much closer to my design process, I have a habit of duplicating the frame I am working on and making small changes each time. This serves thrice as recording a history of the design process, not worrying about deleting things and making large changes, and a way of laying out and understanding my process spatially. It's much more difficult however to do this in other mediums like writing and film editing.

I was thinking, how might we be able to explore the space of potential icons of the future? An interesting experiment would be to make an input field with a button to the right, and then switch out the icon with various things: a tree, a snowflake, a cobweb, and then have people write what they think the button would do. Of course, instead of an input an button you can switch this out for other contexts, like a toolbar for example; this may well lead to different results.

## #? Reaching out

I was imagining how we might interact with VR / AR interfaces. It would have to be more physically embodied than interfaces of today. I can see myself extending my arm in any direction, saying what I want (e.g. "calculator", or "volume") and then pulling my hand back with what I asked for.

Then when I don't need something anymore, I can "throw" it out of the space and it will disappear into the various constellations of apps and services around me.

This feels like it aligns with the `COMPUTER AS ASSISTANT` metaphor since you can reach out and ask for something, then your computer will go find / retrieve it and hand it to you.

## #? Digital community garden

There's a lot of talk these days about digital *gardens*, but what about digital *community gardens*?

In a physical community garden you'll occasionally bump into fellow gardeners, spark up a conversation while you tend to your beets.

Occasionally you all come together for garden parties, all helping out with various tasks and maintenance around the garden, or there'll be workshops teaching how to use or sharpen various tools

## #? Starfish color picker

<!--Color pickers are finicky, you keep having to switch between different sliders or panels to get the color you want. What if you could make a color picker that maps a three-dimensional color space into two dimensions?

I call it the starfish color picker because it looks a bit like a starfish-->

What if you could explore higher-dimensional spaces in two dimensions?

I made a little starfish color picker where you can drag along three dimensions of hue, saturation, and lightness
