## #? Intensity

Imagine if our digital tools had levels of intensity

If you can grab to drag-and-drop objects, what if you could power-grab to drag interface elements around? or use the circular saw to simply cut your desktop in half into two separate workspaces...

## #? Reaching out

I was imagining how we might interact with VR / AR interfaces. It would have to be more physically embodied than interfaces of today. I can see myself extending my arm in any direction, saying what I want (e.g. "calculator", or "volume") and then pulling my hand back with what I asked for.

Then when I don't need something anymore, I can "throw" it out of the space and it will disappear into the various constellations of apps and services around me.

This feels like it aligns with the `COMPUTER AS ASSISTANT` metaphor since you can reach out and ask for something, then your computer will go find / retrieve it and hand it to you.

## #? Digital community garden

There's a lot of talk these days about digital *gardens*, but what about digital *community gardens*?

In a physical community garden you'll occasionally bump into fellow gardeners, spark up a conversation while you tend to your beets.

Occasionally you all come together for garden parties, all helping out with various tasks and maintenance around the garden, or there'll be workshops teaching how to use or sharpen various tools

## #? Starfish color picker

<!--Color pickers are finicky, you keep having to switch between different sliders or panels to get the color you want. What if you could make a color picker that maps a three-dimensional color space into two dimensions?

I call it the starfish color picker because it looks a bit like a starfish-->

What if you could explore higher-dimensional spaces in two dimensions?

I made a little starfish color picker where you can drag along three dimensions of hue, saturation, and lightness
