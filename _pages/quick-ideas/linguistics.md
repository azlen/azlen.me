*Language continually fascinates me from every angle; every word, every metaphor, language shapes how we think, it is the shadow of society's collective mind.*

## #8: Possible paradoxes

Simply by the way we categorize ideas, it can be possible for something to exhibit two seemingly paradoxical or opposing properties at the same time. Perhaps, for example, a place can be both welcoming and uninviting at the same time?

I started thinking about this while writing up my post on [Cyberspace to Cyberplace](/writing/cyberspace-to-cyberplace.md). Some of the qualities that make a something place-like were seemingly opposites: **predictability** vs. **serendipity**; **permanence** vs. **ephemerality**; etc.

However I don't think either of those are contradictory at all, they only appear so based on their mental categorizations. Not only can something exhibit both permanence and ephemerality, but perhaps both are *required* to work towards creating a *sense of place*.

This idea leads me to think there ought to be a word for two concepts that appear contradictory yet unify towards the same purpose or goal. Some ideas:

- Contrastruct (contradict + construct)
- Conflerge (conflicting + merge)
- Balancers
- Antidoxian (anti- + paradox)
- Super-supposition (super position + idea)
- Mentanglement (mental + entanglement)
- Mutually inclusive

Personally I'm most drawn to **Conflerge** and **Contrastruct**, but I will continue to be on the look out for new words that might fit this concept.

## #7: Metaphors we design by

Whether or not you agree with Lakoff's central premise in *Metaphors We Live By*, there is absolutely no doubt that metaphors play an immense role when it comes to design. Once you start to look, our world is practically built on metaphors—it is the mortar of ideas and inventions.

Our computers for example would look much different if they were not fundamentally based upon a desktop metaphor, whereupon we move around folders and files and layer various documents ontop of each other in our workspace. What if computers were designed around a metaphor of *magic*, or *gardens*, or even just a *room* instead of a desk?

<!--Or imagine our cities without the metaphor of the `CITY AS AN ORGANISM`—the famous architect Le Corbusier took formal inspiration from this metaphor to design his utopian vision for a new Paris, which he called *La Ville Radieuse*. He drew inspiration from the body in all the wrong ways, designing monotonous apartment blocks inspired by the uniformity of cells and separating the city into different functions (business, residential, manufacturing, etc.) just like how our organs are each specialized to perform particular functions.

![Corbusier's *La Ville Radieuse*, or "Radiant City" was anything but radiant](/images/corbusier_ville-radieuse_street.png)

Thankfully Corbusier's vision never became realized, but he inspired an entire generation of urban planners, which in turn shaped the zoning laws in many cities and led to some of the most disasterous public housing projects of the 20th century.

## #6: New conceptual metaphors

George Lakoff writes that metaphors shape how we think, percieve, and understand the world[^lakoff]. For example we understand `ARGUMENT AS WAR`, which surfaces itself through everyday language such as "I shot down her argument," or "I defended my position." 

[^lakoff]: Lakoff, George, and Mark Johnson. Metaphors We Live By. University of Chicago Press, 1981.

Lakoff poses a thought experiment to imagine a society that instead treats `ARGUMENT AS DANCE`, would understanding arguments in this way fundamentally change the way we interact?

## #5: What is the oldest metaphor?

Linguists often trace back histories and etymologies of *words*, but what about metaphors? Instead of etymology, I call this "metymology"

One example that comes to mind of how a conceptual metaphor has changed and shifted over time is the metaphor between cities and humans / organisms. The metaphor of the city being alive pervades 20th century architectural thought, and even shows up in everyday language (we talk about going to the "heart of the city"). However this metaphor can be traced back over two-thousand years to the time of Plato; except, he spoke instead of the human body / soul as a city.

Metaphors are bridges really, they work in both directions. They simply tend to flow[^flow] from what we know well to that which we don't know so well.

[^flow]: Maybe a river analogy might work better given that it feels natural to use the word "flow" here, metaphors *flow* from one place of knowledge to another. This fits well with the `KNOWLEDGE AS LANDSCAPE` metaphor that I tend to think about in terms of learning and understanding particular topics

I might imagine that the metaphor of something being "set in stone" could have originated around when laws were first being carved into the [Code of Ur-Nammu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Ur-Nammu) or [Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi)

## #4: My Feed

People always talk about how "user" is used primarily in two contexts: software and addiction

But how often do you think about "feed" (as a noun) which is used most in the contexts of social media and food for pigs[^notjustpigs]

[^notjustpigs]: Of course, not *just* pigs—we generally use the term in regards to most farm animals, and also birds (apt for twitter, huh?), pigs just seemed like a more powerful way to end the sentence

*Consumption, food for thought, digestion, information diets, "my feed"*—it's unnerving to me that we treat information, and by extension social media, as naught but intellectual chow

## #3: Compound Chains

Another question popped into my head the other day related to compound words: *what is the longest possible compound word chain?*

For example: `horsepower, powerboat, boatman, manhole`

Each successive word must start with the last part of the previous compound word

Because of the overlap between words you could write these chains out all as one single word, I think it would be funnier this way:

`horsepowerboatmanhole`

As a second rule, I think it makes sense that you should not be able to come back to the same word / component of a word twice. So in the example above, if I had instead chosen "manpower" then I would've looped back around to the word "power"

What is the longest possible chain? I imagine it could be hundreds of words long, or dozens at the least!

Maybe someday I'll try and find out...

## #2: Character Matrix

After exploring what might be the largest compound word grid in English I thought back to this Chinese character matrix:

![](/images/chinese-character-matrix.png)

As someone learning Mandarin myself, I find this hilarious and am surprised that I can recognize at least a few of the characters on the right-hand side of the equation. Is this the largest possible matrix of Chinese characters? Or what about creating a compound word grid with chinese characters combining to form words?

It brings up a thought of what a compound word grid might look like in different languages. I don't know enough to try this but I imagine in German you might be able to create a 12x12 word grid because there's so much compounding!

## #1: What is the largest compound word grid?

Imagine a spreadsheet where each column and row is a word, and the intersections of each pair of words forms a compound word. What's the largest possible grid you can make like this in english?

I spent a couple hours on the problem, and this was what I came up with:

![](/images/compound-word-grid.png)

I think I'm cheating a bit here with "mangold" because it's not a compound word, *it's a vegetable*!

You can make bigger compound word grids but they tend to be filled with even more obscure words, take this grid for example that I found in an [old article](/refs/EulerianMagicWordSquares.pdf) in the [Word Ways Magazine](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/)

![](/images/compound-word-grid-wordways.png)

Despite being made by the author for a different reason (creating magic word squares) it fits my own prompt perfectly, we can see in the top-left that we can construct a 6x6 word grid with `[fish, back, weed, wood, head, tail] + [red, black, green, white, silver, yellow]`

*Actually*, it can be a 6x7 grid because I looked up "bluetail" and it came up as a word

I wonder if you can find any larger word grids by writing a program to analyze every possible combination—the difficulty here is actually finding a large and lenient enough lookup dictionary of words. Some of the words in the 6x7 grid are so obscure that a short python script I wrote could not find all the words even after pulling from three different large corpuses: a word frequency list from film/tv/subtitles, an entire en_US dictionary used for spellchecking, and the *entirety* of Wiktionary!
