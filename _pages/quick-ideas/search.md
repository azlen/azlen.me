## #5: Tone

Search for `"I like"`, `"I want"`, `"I think"`, etc. to filter results into first-person point of view / tone. Alternatively do the same for `we` or `you` though this might less reliably bring good results (a company might refer to itself as `we`)

## #4: Metaphors

`"X is like" "metaphor"`...
`the metaphor of X`
`"to think of X as a" OR "to think of X as an"`

## #3: Essence of

`the essence of X` = downwards exploration
`X is the essence of` = upwards exploration

alternatives: `the true essence of X`, `the real essence of X`, `X is in essence`, `in essence, X is`, `X is essentially`...

## #2: Omitting common words

You can omit words in google search with a simple subtraction operator (`-WORD`), recently I realized this is possible even with common words like `-and -to -the`. The results here are... interesting. Mostly sites without descriptions, sometimes some interesting gems.

## #1: Combining Terms

To find people in a similar thoughtspace, I take note of interesting n-grams or terms that particularly resonate with me. For example "failure machines" or "intimacy gradient." I will take terms like this and combine them with quotation marks in a google search. Sometimes I will search two very specific terms, other times I will have the second term be a way of filtering down the type of results I'm interested in. For example, `"intimacy gradient" "online space"` or `"failure machines" "education system"`
