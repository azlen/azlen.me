This is a page of small futures; projects, experiments, and ideas that would be fun but I probably haven't had time for yet.

*Think of this page as an invitation to any friends, mutuals, or enigmatic strangers to collaborate with me on a weekend project. Reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/azlenelza) or [email](mailto:contact@azlen.me) if something here sparks your interest.*

- Linguistic analysis to find the longest compound word square (or chain)
- Make an [iceberg video](/@/iceberg-videos) on computer history or increasingly obscure interfaces
- Experiment with collaborative echo chamber for ideation, communication, etc.
- Make a text editor you can interact with without a keyboard (voice + AI)
- Japanese version of abstract orange lice game [^japanese]
- Small platform for people to propose learning experiments and find people to join
- Write a song (or album) related to computer history, future of computing, urban design, etc.
- Make a little social internet radar, keeping track of changes (not just RSS) across friends' personal websites and links between different posts
	- This would also be useful for keeping track of changes on my own website over time, or as a community hub for a webring
- Contextual paste, using language models to experiment with a smart contextual paste that matches the style of things around it
- Return to visual mnemonics (for Hanzi/Kanji) using more modern image models, and automate to generate visual mnemonics for thousands of characters
- Finish APL Cards
- Exploring directions in which English can be naturally extended to enable thinking new thoughts (inventing/mapping out generative affixes, playing around with agglutination, shapes of meaning...)

- Make a book of bad design â€” with the intention of carving out the rules so that we know where to break them

- Platform where you can find people who have shared interest in small projects (the simplest version of this is getting a bunch of friends to write their own "side-quest" pages and then collecting them all together into one place, much like the trend of [/now pages](https://nownownow.com/))[^learning-groups]

- Make a drawing tool for ipad where you can sketch an interface and then immediate be able to interact with your drawing. Say you draw a slider, you can start dragging the handle.
- Design posters for really mundane, every-day objects

- 

Events to host?
- Je m'apparel: a short apparel design session to create a piece of clothing that is unique to you, or communicates some aspect of your thoughts/personality

*This page is still under construction, more links, context, and ideas soon to come!*

[^japanese]: Would love to collaborate with a native Japanese speaker on this, even just to brainstorm whether it'd be possible

[^learning-groups]: Something I learned from running several [learning groups](/@/learning-groups) is that gathering around a specific shared goal is stronger than gathering around a shared topic. It gives direction. And it's easier to shift directions as a group than it is to decide on a direction in a group that has none.
