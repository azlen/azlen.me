title: "Musings on Jigsaw Worlds"

These are my experiments in [applied science fiction](/applied-science-fiction), writing design-fictions as a kind of [bottom up design](/bottom-up-design) exploration of possible futures.  

*Fiction*[^1] helps to ground my thoughts and designs in human experience and to consider aspects of the mind, perception, and interaction that I might not otherwise have considered.

[^1]: If you'd prefer non-fiction, hop on over to my [design journal](/writing) for more thoughts and design explorations
