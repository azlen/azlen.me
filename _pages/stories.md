title: "Musings on Jigsaw Worlds"
---

These are my experiments in [applied science fiction](/703), writing design-fictions as a kind of [Bottom Up Design](/bottom-up-design) exploration of possible futures.  

*Fiction* [^1] helps to ground my thoughts and designs in human experience and to consider aspects of the mind, perception, and interaction that I might not otherwise have considered.

[^1]: *If you'd prefer non-fiction, hop on over to my [blog](/blog) for more thoughts and design explorations*

*Exploring the future of interfaces, new operating systems, and rethinking how we interact with the everyday technology around us.*
