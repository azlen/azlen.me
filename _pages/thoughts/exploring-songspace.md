My technique for discovering music is very similar to my [combinatory search technique](/thoughts/combinatory-search-technique) for exploring the internet. Often I will simply search spotify for an interesting term, or a word I make up on the spot. The ideas is that if an artist is creative or weird enough to come up with the same title then they must make interesting music. And it works.
