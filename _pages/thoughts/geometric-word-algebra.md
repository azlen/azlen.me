Start by choosing three words and writing them on three sides of a triangle on a piece of paper. Then, following the geometric rules below, "add" or "subtract" the words together[^adding], adding new lines and words as you go.

[^adding]: Try to imagine what the intersection of two words might be, perhaps "path" + "motor" = "car" for example?<br><br>Remember, there is no right answer so sometimes it's best to simply write the first thing that comes to mind

As you keep adding words around your starting triangle, it may start looking like a more complex shape, for example:
