Work and singing have often been intertwined throughout history, groups of people would sing songs as they worked both to help coordinate and to pass the time.

I have recently experimented with making up my own "work songs" for various tasks and projects. Often just recording an improvized song to then listen to on repeat. I have written before how [music replaces my thought process](/thoughts/music-suppresses-thought.md), but by listening to my own song it has the effect of essentially "locking" my context and if I ever get distracted (e.g. looking at Twitter) then the song pulls me back into the task I meant to be doing.
