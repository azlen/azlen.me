Found while searching `"窑洞" "心理学"` ([chinese cave dwellings](https://socks-studio.com/2021/06/21/living-inside-the-earth-the-yaodong-cave-buildings-in-china/) + psychology)

Piqued my interest because there seems to be papers written about Chen Yuan Hui's educational theories yet I can't find much about him on the English internet.

Unfortunately I can't access any of the chinese papers or research journals because they all require logins and chinese phone number...
