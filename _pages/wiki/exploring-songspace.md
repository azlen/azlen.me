<!-- I have a strange relationship with music. For example, I never listened to music when I was younger because I found that [music suppresses thought](/wiki/music-suppresses-thought), and also I have [never been able](/wiki/fragmentary-memory) to remember lyrics or melodies. I will also sometimes make up my own songs to [listen to as I work](/wiki/work-songs). -->

My technique for discovering music is very similar to my [combinatory search technique](/wiki/combinatory-search-technique) for exploring the internet. Often I will just search spotify for an interesting term, or a word I make up on the spot, with the idea that if an artist is creative or weird enough to come up with the same title then they must make interesting music. And it works.

<!--Often this leads me to stumble upon undiscovered artists on Spotify, sometimes musicians with only "1 monthly listener" (that's me!). It saddens me because these are sometimes some of the best artists! -->
