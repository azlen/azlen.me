I've never been able to remember songs, plots from movies, narratives of books, etc. If I try to remember a song I might get fragmentary bits, a few disconnected lines here and there, maybe a vague impression of a melody, but nothing remotely close to resembling the song as a whole.

Often, if I'm in the mood to sing, I will opt to making up the lyrics as I go. Sometimes I will even record these sessions and make note of particularly interesting lines or melodies in case I someday want to write a song of my own.
