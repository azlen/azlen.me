*Half-finished ideas, and the machinery of the imagination lie scattered around the space. You overhear deep conversations, and the constant hammering of shaping nebulous thoughts into tangible experiments.*

- Thinking about temporal interfaces, been tinkering with an idea for a [history clock](/@/history-clock) that tells time via events throughout history
- Adding backlinks to this website give more avenues of exploration
- Exploring ways we can create interfaces around language or diffusion models that are creatively empowering, increasing our agency and creative expression rather than replacing or diminishing it.

## What's next?

- Start getting into videomaking, as a medium to communicate more in-depth ideas

- Working on putting finishing touches on [emojibot](/@/emojibot), a discord bot for piping/transcluding messages between channels
- Making a little card-based brainstorming tool
- Working on documenting [projects](/projects) and getting into the rhythm of updating [this website](/@/personal-website) more frequently
- Starting a new wave of [learning experiments](/learn)

## What's next?

- Been thinking about how [cozyroom](/@/cozyroom) was a valuable tool (to me) for brainstorming and prototyping new interfaces
- Explore experiments in new interfaces for interacting with AI models in creatively empowering ways that goes beyond chat interfaces
