*Half-finished ideas, and the machinery of the imagination lie scattered around the space. You overhear deep conversations, and the constant hammering of shaping nebulous thoughts into tangible experiments.*

- Exploring ways to build interfaces for intelligent systems that go beyond the plateau of chatâ€” that are creatively empowering or allow us to query/understand the models in meaningful ways
- Tinkering with swift and react native to build out a couple personal app ideas: weird little camera/photo-walk app, a new language learning tool, etc.
- Designing a couple board games: a simple word game, and an overly complicated cyberpunk-themed card game where each card represents a different faction with their own goals and abilities

- Working on putting finishing touches on [emojibot](/@/emojibot), a discord bot for piping/transcluding messages between channels
- Making a little card-based brainstorming tool
- Working on documenting [projects](/projects) and getting into the rhythm of updating [this website](/@/personal-website) more frequently
- Starting a new wave of [learning experiments](/learn)

## What's next?

- Been thinking about how [cozyroom](/@/cozyroom) was a valuable tool (to me) for brainstorming and prototyping new interfaces
- Explore experiments in new interfaces for interacting with AI models in creatively empowering ways that goes beyond chat interfaces
