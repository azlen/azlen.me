Welcome to the digital materials blog club! _Some questions we're exploring together_:

- How can our data / interfaces be more tangible, like materials that can be shaped, combined, and interacted with in coherent and reliable ways?
- The importance of mental models for interacting with digital space
- Are there some basic primitives for understanding how data might be represented through an interface in different ways?

These questions are merely a brief overview, continue by reading the seed prompt and submissions down below for more context.

## Submissions

_The questions above are just a sample of some of the questions we've put forward in our prompts for this blog club, read these two prompts for more context and exploration:_
