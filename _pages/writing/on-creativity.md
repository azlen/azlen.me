*Stop Thinking.*

Yes I said it. *Just. Stop. Thinking.*

More and more I find my own thinking getting in the way of actually doing, actually *making* something. So if I were to give one piece of advice on how to be creative it would be to stop *thinking* and start *doing*.

Furthermore, the more I think the harder a project seems. It's relatively simple to break an idea into steps, and then separate those steps into smaller substeps and so on. *Don't do this*. This is the real-life counterpart of Zeno's paradox with Achilles and the tortoise; if you keep subdividing forever you'll never make it to the finish line!

One of my favourite quotes is by Ivan Sutherland, upon being asked how he invented such a plethora of things in the field of computing in one year, he replied, "Well, I didn't know it was hard"

*He didn't know it was hard*

So, *stop knowing*

Forget about easy or hard. Question what you know. A dishwasher makes washing dishes look easy right, or does it simply make washing dishes by hand look hard? Be wary of things that look easy, because they reinforce your assumptions of difficulty

Look at the world with fresh eyes. A child sees nothing as impossibleâ€” I built my own laptop when I was seven by drawing a keyboard on a folded sheet of paper. Us adults with all our *thinking* and *knowing*, all our "experience" is a shrinking bubble of possibility, a filter blocking us from seeing with a fresh perspective

In my experience, creativity comes not from knowing or thinking but from *doing*. In my most creative periods I will look back and think, "how did I do it?" because the thinking mind can't possibly fathom the unreasonable effectiveness of not thinking
