Imagine reading a newspaper for a place that doesn't exist. You read about the people and their lives, their parks and their laws; you read about the criminals and the recently-shut-down coal mine; the complaints of water quality and the strange purple miasma billowing out of the gutters on 49th street. _The more you read, the more the place seems to come alive._

**Place is an act of make-believe.** It might take years to design and construct a building, but through stories we can construct places in our minds within seconds.

I set out on a journey to imagine a _digital campus_, what does it look like? what does it feel like? what opportunities can it provide? I imagined websites as the rooms, links as the corridors, presence indicators to see people as they pass by. _But none of this really matters_. It is nothing but a vague approximation at applying physical metaphors to digital spacesâ€”it forgets that place exists not in the screen but in the mind.

A digital campus does not need any complex technology, it does not need a platform, it does not even need a website.

All it needs is a story.

In its simplest form, I imagine a digital campus to be much like a newspaper of a place that doesn't exist. One that is collectively written together. It is sent out each week listing challenges and events sprouting up within the community; stories of the virtual campus we're all a-part of; the books people have found on the the nearly-infinite shelves of the campus library; people's favourite hang-out spots?

You don't "go" to campus, the campus comes to you; right there in your inbox on Monday morning. You don't "stay" on campus, the campus stays with you. The campus is both everywhere and nowhere; it exists inside your mind and follows you wherever your mind wanders.
