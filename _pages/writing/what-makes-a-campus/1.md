*In a campus there's many people, you see people about* â€” **sense of presence**

*In a campus there's many spaces, resources, workshops *â€” **sense of opportunity**

*In a campus there are many teachers, mentors, and knowing students* â€” **sense of mentorship / network / community**

*In a campus there are many classes, you can supposedly decide which ones to take* â€” **a sense of choice**

*In a campus you have a chance to bump into or hang out with your friends, and the possibility in some cases of forming deeper relationships* â€” **a sense of connection / friendship**

*In a campus you are outside the expectation or pressure that your work is for a particular job (though unfortunately grades often lead to less risk-taking and experimentation)* â€” **a sense of freedom**

*In a campus there is often a library, a place to study, meet, or seek knowledge* â€” **a sense of knowledge / coziness / third place**

*In a campus there are often lots of clubs you can join* â€” **a sense of subcultures**

*In a campus you have the possibility of branching out or pushing yourself out of a single discipline, try different things out* â€” **a sense of dabbling**



**In summary**:

-   presence
-   opportunity
-   mentorship
-   community
-   connection
-   freedom / dabbling
-   knowledge
-   subcultures / niches
-   workshops / resources
-   ... (what else?)
