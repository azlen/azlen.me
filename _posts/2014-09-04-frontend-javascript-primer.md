This interactive, workshop-style tech talk I first gave as a part of an event called Web Dev Weeks (later: [Web Dev Weekend](https://github.com)). Web Dev Weeks was designed to
give students at Carnegie Mellon an introduction to aspects of web development like frontend and backend development, interface and interaction design, and automated site deployment.

Fitting in with that theme, the Frontend JavaScript Primer talk taught students how to write JavaScript using jQuery by building an interactive, tile-based game.

One of my favorite parts of this talk is that it uses commits and the GitHub interface to show participants the diff of exactly what changed alongside a description of how to complete the step.
